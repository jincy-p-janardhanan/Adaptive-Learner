But she knows she has to get up. She mutters to herself.\r\nNeha : This alarm clock always rings at six and pulls me out of the bed! It\u2019s so unfair...Oh, how I would love to sleep a little longer in the morning! I wish this clock would forget its job sometimes.\r\nNarrator : Something falls. Neha smiles.\r\nNeha : Oh! My clock has fallen. How happy I am! Tomorrow I can get up late.\r\nNarrator : Next morning there is no alarm. So Neha sleeps and sleeps. The small chirpy birds which come to the window sill every morning find Neha still sleeping.\r\nBirds : Wake up dear! Wake up fast!\r\nNarrator : Neha gets up with a start.\r\nNeha : Oh, no! If it\u2019s not the alarm clock, it\u2019s these birds\u2026 why don\u2019t they leave me alone?\r\nNarrator : Even this wish of Neha\u2019s comes true. The next morning there is not only no alarm clock, there are no birds either. But there is someone else who does not want her to miss the school bus. Can you guess who it is? The big bright Sun! He fills Neha\u2019s room with a warm smile.\r\nNeha : Oh, my eyes! Now it\u2019s the Sun waking me up! Why can\u2019t he let me be?\r\nNarrator : Even this wish of Neha\u2019s comes true. Next morning the Sun is behind the clouds. So, Neha snores till she hears her mother\u2019s voice...\r\nMother : Wake up, sleepy head. You will miss the bus.\r\nNeha : Oh no! Why does mother have to wake me up?\r\nNarrator : There is no escape now. Neha gets up and gets ready. Can you imagine what happens the next day? Neha wakes up with a start. Her watch says it is six o\u2019clock. She calls out to her mother.\r\nNeha : Ma, who woke me up today?\r\nNarrator : Mother smiles.\r\nMother : Who else? You, of course!\r\nNeha : But, I was sleeping, how could I \u2026?\r\nMother : Now, tell me, why do you eat your lunch every day at one in the afternoon?\r\nNeha : I feel hungry.\r\nMother : Why do you sleep at nine every night?\r\nNeha : Because I feel sleepy.\r\nMother : There is a clock inside you which tells you when to eat, when to sleep and when to wake up.\r\nNeha : Oh! Ooh! I better rush now. I don\u2019t want to miss the bus.\r\nMother : RELAX! Today is Sunday!\r\nNeha : Oh! Oh! Oh!",

Take this bow and arrows.\u201d\r\nThen pointing towards a target, he said, \u201cAim at that target and shoot an arrow.\u201d\r\nNasruddin held the bow in his hands, strung it, aimed at the target and shot an arrow.\r\nWh...o...o...o...o...\r\nThe arrow didn\u2019t hit the target! Instead, it fell down somewhere in the middle.\r\n\u201cHa...ha...ha...ha...\u201d\r\nHis friends started laughing. They said, \u201cHey, Nasruddin! Is this your best aim?\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, no! Not at all,\u201d said Nasruddin, defending himself.\r\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t my aim. It was Azad\u2019s aim. I just showed you how Azad shoots an arrow.\u201d\r\nSaying this, Nasruddin picked up another arrow.\r\nOnce again, he strung the bow, aimed at the target, and shot the arrow.\r\nThis time, the arrow fell a little further from where it had fallen before.\r\nBut it certainly didn\u2019t hit the target!\r\nThey asked Nasruddin, \u201cAnd this must be how you shoot an arrow!\u201d\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d argued Nasruddin. \u201cEven this aim was not mine. It was the chief guard\u2019s aim.\u201d\r\nNow somebody remarked, \u201cWell... Now who\u2019s next on the list?\u201d\r\nHearing this, all the friends burst out laughing.\r\nNasruddin didn\u2019t say a word. He quietly picked up one more arrow. And again...\r\nAnd this time Nasruddin was really lucky! The arrow hit right on the target!\r\nEverybody stared at Nasruddin, their mouths agape in amazement.\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, Nasruddin said triumphantly, \u201cDid you see that?

He took out a big watch from his waistcoat pocket and as he hurried away, he said, \u201cOh dear, I will be too late!\u201d\r\nShe thought there was something very different about this rabbit. It could talk, it wore a red waistcoat, and it carried a watch. Alice was burning with curiosity and she followed the white rabbit.\r\nThe rabbit started running and Alice followed the rabbit. The rabbit suddenly popped down a large rabbit hole. Alice jumped into the rabbit hole too! The rabbit went down and down and down and down into the rabbit hole.\r\nAlice said aloud, \u201cWhere am I? How many miles down have I fallen? I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth.\u201d She wondered, \u201cWill I slip through the earth to the other side?\u201d\r\nThump! Alice landed on a pile of dry leaves. She looked around quickly and suddenly saw the white rabbit again. It disappeared saying, \u201cOh, my ears and whiskers! How late it\u2019s getting!\u201d\r\nAlice stood up and saw a small door about fifteen inches high. It was too small for her to go through.\r\nShe saw a glass table with a golden key on it. She tried the little golden key in the lock and to her delight it fitted!\r\nAlice opened the door and looked into the loveliest garden she had ever seen! How she longed to be among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains! But she could not even get her head through the doorway.\r\n\u201cOh! How I wish, I could become smaller!\u201d she exclaimed loudly.\r\n",

The baby may not live.\u201d\r\nHelen lived. But she was not the same after her illness. \u201cSomething is very wrong,\u201d her mother said. At last, they found out what was wrong. The child could not see or hear.\r\nThe baby grew into a little girl. Her parents felt sorry for her. Helen often cried and held on to her mother. \u201cGive the poor child what she wants,\u201d her father would say.\r\nThough Helen could not hear or see, she was a bright little girl. Some people thought Helen could not learn anything. Her mother did not agree. \u201cHelen is very smart,\u201d she said and added, \u201cthe problem is, how can we reach her? She is locked up inside herself.\u201d\r\nHelen began to grow wild. She would not let anyone comb her hair. Her clothes were always dirty. She was often angry. Sometimes she even lay on the floor and kicked her feet.\r\nHer parents thought that they should find a teacher for her. Miss Sullivan, a young teacher, agreed to help Helen to learn to see the world. Miss Sullivan gave Helen a doll. \u201cD_O_L_L\u201d spells doll. She spelt the word with her fingers into Helen\u2019s hand. She made the letters with special hand signs.\r\nHelen copied her teacher and spelt D_O_L_L too, but she did not understand what she was doing. Helen liked Miss Sullivan. She was strict but kind. She spelt a lot of words for Helen, on her hand, day and night, to make Helen understand.\r\nOne day, her teacher made Helen put her hand into running water. Then, she spelt W_A_T_E_R. Suddenly, Helen understood that W_A_T_E_R meant something wet, running over her hand. She understood that words were the most important things in the world. Words would tell her everything she wanted to know.\r\n",

Now he was an old man but the tree recognised him.\r\nTree : I am sorry, friend, but I have nothing left to give you. My apples are gone.\r\nOld man : My teeth are too weak for apples.\r\nTree : My branches are gone. You cannot swing on them.\r\nOld man : I am too old to swing on branches.\r\nTree : My trunk is gone. You cannot climb.\r\nOld man : I am too tired to climb.\r\nTree : (sighing) I am sorry. I wish that I could give you something\u2026 but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump. I am sorry\u2026\r\nOld man : Dear tree, you have always given.

You\u2019re tickling me.\u201d\r\nThe old man was puzzled by the voice. He said, \u201cThis is a strange piece of wood. What shall I do with it? I think I\u2019ll make it into a puppet.\u201d\r\nHe set to work, and as the puppet boy took shape, the old man said, \u201cHe must have a name. I will call him Pinocchio.\u201d\r\nAs soon as he finished making the eyes, the carpenter was amazed to see them move. Before the mouth was made, it began to laugh. \u201cStop laughing!\u201d the old man said.\r\nIt did stop, but as soon as his back was turned, it put out its tongue. And its nose grew long.\r\nNo sooner were its hands ready than it snatched off the carpenter\u2019s wig and put it on its own head. And then Pinocchio\u2019s nose grew longer.\r\nWhen its legs and feet were made, they were too stiff to use, so the carpenter showed Pinocchio how to use them.\r\nNow, the carpenter decided to send Pinocchio to school. But there, Pinocchio did nothing but look for fun. He often ran away from school.\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to school?\u201d asked the carpenter. Pinocchio told him a lie... and his nose started growing longer and longer.\r\nEach time he was rude to someone or told a lie, his nose grew longer. Finally, Pinocchio said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be a real boy. I\u2019ll never lie again.\u201d\r\n",

        "content": "Deep in a forest stood a very tall tree. Its leafy branches spread out like strong arms.\r\nThis tree was the home of a flock of wild geese. They felt safe there. One of the geese was a wise old bird.\r\nHe noticed a small creeper at the foot of the tree.\r\nHe spoke to the other birds about it.\r\n\u201cDo you see that creeper?\u201d he said to them. \u201cLet us destroy it\u201d. \u201cWhy must we destroy it?\u201d asked the geese in surprise. \u201cIt is so small. What harm can it do?\u201d \u201cMy friends,\u201d replied the wise old bird, \u201cthat little creeper will soon grow. As it creeps up this tree, it will become thick and strong.\u201d \r\n\u201cWhat of that?\u201d asked the geese. \u201cWhat harm can a creeper do us?\u201d\r\n\u201cDon't you see?\u201d replied the wise bird, \u201cwith the help of that creeper, it will be possible for someone to climb this tree. A hunter can come up and kill us all.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no hurry,\u201d they replied, \u201cthe creeper is very small. It would be a pity to destroy it now.\u201d\r\n\u201cDestroy the creeper while it is still young,\u201d the old bird advised. \u201cNow it is tender and you can cut it easily. Later it will become hard and you will not be able to cut it.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d answered the birds. But they did not destroy the creeper. They forgot the wise old bird\u2019s advice. As the creeper grew, it began winding its way up the tree.\r\nStronger and stronger it became, until it was as strong as a thick rope.\r\nOne morning when the geese had gone out in search of food, a hunter came to the forest. \r\n\u201cSo this is where the wild geese live,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhen they come back in the evening, I shall catch them.\u201d\r\nThe hunter climbed up the tree with the help of the creeper. He got to the top and spread his net there. Then he climbed down and went away.\r\nIn the evening, the geese returned home. They did not notice the net. As they flew into the tree, they were trapped. They struggled hard to get out, but could not. \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d cried the geese. \u201cWe are caught in the hunter\u2019s net. Oh! What shall we do?\u201d\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss now,\u201d said the wise old bird. \u201cLong ago I told you to destroy the creeper, but you did not. Now see what has happened. Tomorrow morning the hunter will come back and kill us all.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe were foolish,\u201d wept the birds. \u201cWe are very sorry we did not listen to you. Please tell us what to do?\u201d\r\n\u201cThen listen carefully,\u201d replied the wise bird. \u201cWhen the hunter comes you must all pretend to be dead. Just lie still. The hunter will not want dead birds. He will throw us to the ground. It will then be easy for him to climb down, collect the dead birds, and takethem home. When the last of us has been thrown down, we must quickly get up and fly away.\u201d\r\nIn the morning the hunter came to the tree and climbed up. He looked at the geese in the net.\r\n\u201cThey are all dead,\u201d he muttered to himself.\r\nHe threw them out of the net one by one. The birds lay still until the last one had been thrown down. Then, all at once, they got up, flapped their wings, and flew away.\r\nThe hunter was taken by surprise. From the top of the tree he watched all the geese fly away.\r\n",

        "content": "One day, when I was going towards my boat, I was surprised to see the footprint of a man on the sand. I stood amazed! I listened; I looked around me; I could neither hear nor see anything. I went up higher to look down; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was no good; I could find no other footprint but that one. I went to it again to see if there were any more footprints and to tell if it had been my imagination. But I was not mistaken, for there was exactly the print of a foot \u2014 toes, heel, every part of a foot. I could not imagine how it came there.\r\nI stayed a long time thinking, but became more and more confused. At last I returned home very frightened, looking behind\r\nme after every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree to be a man.\r\nWhen I came to my cave (which I called my castle), I ran inside it, as if I was being chased. I do not remember whether I used the ladder or went in by the hole in the rock, which I called the door. I ran for cover, faster than any animal could run.\r\nI did not sleep that night. The more I thought about what I had seen, the more afraid I became. I thought it could be one of the savages of the mainland who had wandered out to the sea, in a small boat.\r\nLuckily I was not on shore at that time, but what if he had seen my boat! If he had seen the boat he would have realised that someone lived on the island and would soon return with others to kill and eat me.\r\nAnd so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for protection. In doing so, I was much comforted and began going out to investigate. But even now as I went forward,looked behind me frequently, because I was still\r\nvery frightened. However, as I went about for two or three days and saw nothing I became a little bolder. I decided to go down to the shore again and examine the footprint once more. I decided to measure it with my own footmark.\r\nAs I came closer to the footprint, I realised that it could not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of the beach since a long time. Secondly, as I placed my foot alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own.\r\nMy fear returned! I went home again, believing that there was someone there.\r\nThe island was inhabited!\r\n",

The elder brother, Bhaiya, is reading a book and the younger one, Munna, is drawing pictures of birds and animals.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nWhat are you doing, Munna?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI am drawing.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nWhen will you study? Where were you in the morning?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI was playing. Bhaiya, how can you sit with a book for hours together?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nThat's because I want my foundation in education to be very strong. If the base is strong, then the building will stand firmly. Sometimes it takes me two years to do one year's work.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, you are five years older than I am and three classes ahead of me. I wonder why you keep writing the same word twenty times, one sentence more than twenty times, and copy poems several times in beautiful letters?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nYou know, studying English is no child's play. One has to work very hard in order to learn the subject. To speak or write English properly, tremendous effort is required. But the moment you get a chance, you run to the field, play marbles, fly paper kites, or sit idling away with friends for fun! Can\u2019t you sit down and study?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(turning pale)\r\nOh Bhaiya, there is a big mela in the village today. Should we go?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nHave you ever seen me going to a fair or watching a cricket or hockey match? I don't go near them. I prefer to study a book. I don't mind repeating a class for more than two years. But you might stay in the same class all your life. Do you expect to pass if you waste your time playing all the time? You are simply wasting father's hard-earned money.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, I feel like running away and going back home.\r\n(Munna starts crying; sobbing sounds \"wah, wah, bah, bah, hu, hu\" are heard.)\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nNow, now! Stop crying. Put on a nice smile. Look, I will make a timetable for you to follow. Get up at dawn.\r\n\r\nTime | Schedule\r\n\r\n6 AM | Wash your hands\r\n6-8 AM | English\r\n8-9 AM | Maths\r\n9-9:30 AM | History\r\n3:30 PM | Off to school\r\n5-6 PM | Grammar\r\n6:30-7 PM | English composition\r\n8-9 PM | Translation\r\n9-10 PM | Hindi\r\n10-11 PM | Other subjects, then to bed\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBut when is the time to play?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nPlay? What is the need, Munna?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh! I love the green fields, the gentle breeze. I want to jump up like a football! I like the touch-and-go and the sounds of the hu tu tu and the hurry and flurry of volleyball. It pulls me like a magnet. As soon as I am on the field, I forget everything.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAlas! I have failed once again.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh! But Bhaiya, I have passed and topped my class. Now there is only two years difference between us.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nBut my dear brother, don't be so proud. You have passed only one class and you think that I'm stupid and you are smart. Once in a while, in a game, you might get lucky and hit a goal, but that does not mean you have mastered the game. You have to work hard to be successful in life. When you have to study a subject like Algebra or Geometry in higher classes, then you will understand the importance of hard work.\r\n\r\nIn Geometry, if one writes \u2018acb\u2019 instead of \u2018abc,\u2019 the answer is marked wrong. The examiners will not spare you. They want you to learn word by word from the textbooks.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh, Bhaisaheb! This is scary. I don\u2019t think I want to go to the 9th class now, but I will still complete my day\u2019s homework so that I get no punishment in class. Just today, we were asked to write a short essay on the topic of Punctuality in four pages! And imagine, can something be written on four pages and still be short? It\u2019s all so mixed up! Thank God, it was time for school, or else, the scolding would have gone on and on.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(thinking aloud)\r\nAh! I am lucky. I can pass easily. I need not study so hard. Now I can play games with my friends and fly kites. But I should still be careful that Bhaiya does not see me flying kites.\r\n\r\nSCENE 2\r\nThe final exams are over and the results are out.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(talking aloud)\r\nThe results were out once again and it so happened that I passed, and Bhaiya failed again. Bhaiya was really upset. I was also sad seeing my brother so unhappy. Bhaiya now became gentler with me. I, in turn, became naughtier and studied even less than before.\r\n\r\n(One day a kite is flying slowly downwards. Munna starts running in order to grab it. Suddenly, he comes face to face with Bhaiya.)\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAren't you ashamed to be playing kites all day long? Don't you realize that now you are in the eighth class and not studying in a lower class? If you think that I am just one class ahead of you and I can't say anything, you are wrong. I am five years older than you are and will always be. Understanding doesn\u2019t come only from reading books. Look at Ma and Baba. Ma has never gone to school and Baba has only passed the fifth class.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nReally Bhaiya! Is that true?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nYes! There are a thousand things that they know more than you or me. And even if we have studied the wisdom of the whole world, Ma and Baba will always have the right to explain to us and correct us. Now, what would you do if I were to fall sick today?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI don't know, Bhaiya! I would tell Baba and he would rush to the hostel.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAha! I had expected this answer. Now, Baba would not get upset. He would first try to find out what was wrong and then he would call a doctor. Baba would know exactly what to do. They have more experience than us.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, I am sorry. What you say is true. I also like to play and fly kites. But if I also play, then how can I watch out for you? You are my responsibility.\r\nI love you, Bhaiya!\r\n",

        "prologue": "This story is about Rip Van Winkle, a good-natured but lazy man, who goes away into the hills and falls asleep. When he awakens twenty years later, Rip finds that quite a few things have changed!",
        "content": "Many years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill) mountains, was a little village. In the village lived a simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle. He was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. Everyone in the village liked him. The children of the village shouted with joy whenever they saw him because he played with them, he taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories.\r\nThe only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy. He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his time. His fences were falling to pieces. His cow was going astray. Weeds grew on his farm. Rip's constant companion was his dog, named Wolf. To avoid work, he would walk away into the forest with his dog.\r\nOne day, Rip just walked on and on and reached the highest part of the mountains. It was late in the afternoon when he reached there. Tired after his long climb, he lay down and began daydreaming. It was soon evening and he realised it would be night by the time he reached his village.\r\nSuddenly, he heard a voice calling out, \u201cRip Van Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!\u201d He looked around and saw a short, old man, with thick hair and a grizzled beard walking towards him with a barrel. He made signs to help him carry the barrel. Rip hurried to help the stranger who caught his hand tightly. Together they reached a place where there were some more odd looking men, playing ninepins. They were all dressed the same way and all of them had beards of various shapes and colours. Even though they were playing a game, their faces were serious and there was silence! The only sound was the noise of the balls, which echoed in the mountains like thunder.\r\nAs Rip and his companion reached them, they stopped playing and stared at Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip was really frightened. His companion emptied the contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it. Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear. Since he was thirsty he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a deep sleep.\r\nOn waking up, he found that he was at the place where he had first met the old man. He rubbed his eyes \u2014 it was a bright sunny morning. \u201cSurely, I have not slept here all night,\u201d thought Rip.\r\nHe looked around for Wolf, but he was nowhere. Rip whistled for him. \u201cWolf! Wolf!\u201d he then shouted. No dog was to be seen. \u201cWhere has this dog gone?\u201d he muttered to himself. He began to descend the mountain to go back to his village.\r\nAs he neared the village, he met a number of people but he didn't know any of them. The villagers also stared at him equally surprised. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d said one.\r\n\u201cI've never seen him before,\u201d said another, \u201clook at his long white beard and his wrinkled face.\u201d\r\nOn hearing this, Rip stroked his chin and, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long, and it was all white!\r\nAn old woman walked up to him and looked at his face for a moment. Then she exclaimed \u2014 \u201cIt is Rip Van Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbour! Where have you been these twenty long years?\r\n",

        "prologue": "Long long ago a Sultan, whose name was Shahriar, ruled over a large kingdom. His queen was a good storyteller. Each night she would tell a story to the king. She narrated ancient Persian and Arabic folk stories. This is one of the stories, from the Arabian Nights.",
        "content": "In the city of Cashgar, lived a barber who was a great talker. Once the Sultan called the barber to shave his head. The barber started talking non-stop instead of shaving him. The Sultan got angry. \r\n\u201cWhen are you going to stop talking and begin to do your work?\u201d\r\nThe Barber replied, \u201cYou do me an injury by calling me a chatterer. For, everyone says I am very quiet. I have six brothers whom you might call chatterers. Their names are Bacbone (buk-bon), Bakbarea (buk-buria), Bakbac (buk-buk), Alcouz\r\n(ul-kooz), Alnaschee (ul-nashi) and Schacabac( sha-ka-bak). One is humpbacked, one is toothless, one is half blind, one is quite blind, one is deaf and the other has a defect in his speech and they are all great talkers, but I am the youngest of my family, and I am very quiet and sparing with words.\u201d\r\n\u201cGive him three pieces of gold,\u201d the Sultan cried, losing all patience, \u201cand send him away. I will not be shaved today.\u201d\r\n\u201cMy Master,\u201d cried the Barber, \u201cit was not I who came to seek you, it was you who ordered me to come. So I will not quit your house till I have shaved you.\u201d\r\nHe then began narrating another story, which lasted half an hour.\r\n\u201cStop making your fine speeches and let me go quickly. I have an affair of the greatest importance. I have to go out at noon,\u201d said the Sultan.\r\nWhen he saw that the Sultan was really angry with him, the Barber said, \u201cO Master, do not be angry, I will begin to shave you.\u201d Saying this, he washed the Sultan\u2019s head and began to shave. But he had not touched him even four times with the razor, when he stopped and said, \u201cMy Master, you are acting hastily in this matter.\u201d\r\n\u201cGo on shaving me, speak no more\u201d, ordered the Sultan.\r\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d said the barber, \u201cperhaps you have not considered well what you were going to do. I wish you would tell me what this matter of great importance is all about and then I will give you my opinion on it.\u201d\r\n\u201cFinish shaving at once,\u201d the Sultan exclaimed. But, instead of doing this, the Barber left the Sultan half-shaved to go and see what time it was.\u201c My patience is exhausted,\u201d the Sultan cried.\r\n\u201cBe calm, my Master and you shall be shaved in a moment,\u201d said the Barber and saying this, he continued shaving the Sultan. But while he was doing this, he could not help talking.\r\n\u201cIf you could inform me what this important affair is, I would give more advice, which you might find useful,\u201d he said.\r\nThe Sultan was completely fed up by now and decided to satisfy the barber. He told him that he was giving a feast to some friends at noon which was why he was in a hurry to leave.\r\nWhen the barber heard the Sultan mention a feast he exclaimed, \u201cThat reminds me. Yesterday, I invited four or five friends to come to my house today. But I had quite forgotten it and have not made any preparations for them.\u201d The Sultan who was at the mercy of the Barber, was ready to do anything to be rid of him. \r\n\u201cBe quick and finish your work,\u201d the Sultan replied, \u201cand you shall have all the food that has been prepared for me today.\u201d\r\n\u201cPlease show me the food so that I may judge if it is enough for my five friends.\u201d\r\n\u201cI have enough food for you!\u201d the Sultan exclaimed. But he ordered that all the food prepared for his feast be brought in.\r\nThe Barber looked over the food and said \u201cThis is very good but I shall want some fruit for the dessert also.\u201d The Sultan, in desperation, since his head was half shaved, ordered that the fruits should also be brought in. The Barber left off shaving the Sultan to examine each dish separately. This took up half an hour.\r\nThe Sultan stamped his feet impatiently but the Barber did not hurry.\r\nAt length, however, he again took up the razor but after a few minutes of work, stopped suddenly and cried, \u201cI never knew that you were so generous.\u201d",

When we came to land we saw no river or spring nor any inhabitants. I went on to explore. The country was barren and rocky. I turned back to join the crew, only to see them getting into the boat and rowing for life to get to the ship.\r\nBefore I could reach them I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could. The water of the ocean reached only till his knees! However, the monster was unable to overtake the speeding boat. I turned back quickly and climbed up a steep hill with fields of barley on either side and the corn rising upto forty feet. There was a fence to pass from one field to the other.\r\nIt was impossible for me to climb because every step was six feet high. I was trying to find a gap in the hedge when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field walking towards the fence. He was of the same size as the creature chasing the boat. I was struck with utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself. He called in a voice much louder than a trumpet. It sounded like thunder! Seven monsters like him came towards the field ready to reap the corn. They carried a reaping hook which was very big. When one of the reapers approached where I lay hidden I screamed as loud as I could. The creature stopped reaping, picked me up between his thumb and forefinger and brought me close to his eyes, sixty feet above the ground. He looked at me with curiosity and blew my hair aside to get a better view of my face.\r\nHe called his friends and gently placed me on the ground.\r\nThey all sat on the ground to take a good look at me. I walked slowly backward and forward, pulled off my hat and made a low bow towards the farmers. I tried to speak to them loudly in several languages. Each time I did so the farmer who picked me up held his ear very close to me but in vain. The farmer took me to his house and placed me at some distance on the dining table which was thirty feet high from the floor.\r\nDinner was brought for the farmer in a dish which was ten feet in diameter. The farmer's wife crumbled some bread and placed it before me. In the middle of the dinner I heard a noise behind me. It was the purring of a cat that was ten times larger than an ox. The farmer's wife was stroking him. Then entered the farmer's one year-old son in the arms of a lady. On seeing me the child grabbed me from the table and put my head into his mouth. I shouted so loudly that the baby dropped me. I would have broken my neck if the mother had not held her apron under me. Later she put me on her own bed and covered me with a clean white handkerchief.\r\nI slept dreaming of my home, my wife and my children.\r\n",

        "content": "Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a small boy called Hari. Although he wasn\u2019t very big, he was strong, and he loved to tease all the boys and girls who went to school with him. What he loved to do most was to pinch. He could make a big bruise appear in half a second. Another trick he played was pricking people with a pin.\r\nSo you can guess how all the children hated him. They tried pinching him back, but that was no good because he could always pinch harder. They didn't like telling their teacher, because that was telling tales.\r\nIt so happened that the class went for a picnic to the seaside for a whole day. All the children were most excited. \r\nOn that day, the sun shone bright, and all the children were wild with excitement. They crowded into the train and sat down \u2014 but nobody wanted to sit next to Hari because he always pinched.\r\nWhen they arrived at the seaside, out jumped all the children with a shout of joy. Down to the sands they raced, hand in hand \u2014 but nobody took Hari\u2019s hand.Nobody went near him.\r\nHari was angry. He went to a sandy corner near a rocky pool and sat down by himself. He took out his lunch and looked at it. It was a good lunch. There were two hard-boiled eggs, six jam sandwiches, three pieces of bread and butter, a ginger cake, and a bar of chocolate.\r\nHe would eat it all by himself. He wouldn't offer anything to anyone!\r\nJust as he was beginning on the eggs, he heard a hoarse voice near him. \u201cGood morning! I am so pleased to meet a boy like you.\u201d Hari turned around and stared in fright. Whatever do you think he saw?\r\nHari saw a monster crab walking sideways out of the pool. His eyes were on the ends of short stalks and he looked most queer. He held out his front claw to Hari. Hari put out his hand to shake the crab\u2019s claw, but to his surprise and anger the crab opened his pincers and nipped his hand so hard that the little boy yelled.\r\n\u201cAh, here is my good cousin,\u201d said the crab pleasantly, and, to Hari\u2019s horror, he saw a large sandy lobster crawling heavily out of the pool. Before the little boy could stop him the lobster took his hand in his great pincer-like claws and pinched it so hard that Hari yelled in pain. Then he stared at the pool in surprise, for, out came sandy-coloured shrimps and prawns, more crabs, and another large lobster and they pricked Hari till he was soon black and blue with their pinching.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d said all the creatures in surprise.\r\n\u201cWhy, we were told you would love to see us because you were a champion pincher and pricker yourself. Come, come join in the fun!\u201d\r\nHari leapt to his feet, crying loudly. His lunch rolled into the pool, and when the crabs and lobsters saw it they ran to it and began to feast eagerly. Hari saw that they had forgotten him for a time, and he turned and ran for his life, tears streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\u201cThey only did to me what I keep doing to the other children,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut how it hurt! And how I hated those crabs and lobsters! I suppose the other children hate me too. Well, I jolly well shan\u2019t pinch or prick any more.\u201d\r\n",

        "prologue": "A king is called a Ningthou and a queen is called a Leima in Manipuri. This is a story from Manipur about what qualities make a good ruler.",
        "content": "Long, long ago, in the land of Kangleipak in Manipur, there lived a Ningthou and a Leima. They were loved dearly by the people.\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima, on their part, never stopped thinking about their meeyam, their people. \u201cOur meeyam should be happy,\u201d they said.\r\nThe people were not the only ones who loved their Ningthou and Leima. The birds and animals too loved them. The Ningthou and Leima always said: \u201cEverybody in Kangleipak should live in peace. Not only the people, but the birds, animals and trees.\u201d\r\nTheir beloved king and queen had three sons: Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba.\r\nTwelve years later, a daughter was born. She was named Sanatombi. She was a lovely child, soft and beautiful inside. She was loved by one and all.\r\nThe years went by, and the children grew up well. And then one day, the Ningthou called all his ministers and said: \u201cIt is now time to decide the Tunggi Ningthou, the future king.\u201d\r\nThe ministers were shocked. \u201cBut O Ningthou, what is there to decide? Sanajaoba, your eldest son, will be our future king.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the Ningthou replied. \u201cThat\u2019s how it happened in the old days. The eldest son always became the king. But times have changed. So let us select a king who is most worthy of becoming a king.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe will have a contest to select the future king,\u201d the Leima said. And so, in the land of Kangleipak, there was a contest, a horse race. Whoever reached the khongnang, the banyan tree, first would be declared Tunggi Ningthou.\r\nBut then, a strange thing happened. Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba all three of them finished the race together. They were expert riders and all three reached the finish line at the same time!\r\nThere was great excitement. \u201cLook at them!\u201d the people shouted. \u201cShagol thauba nupa, such fine horsemen!\u201d\r\nBut one question remained: Who would be the Tunggi Ningthou?\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima turned to their sons. The Ningthou said, \u201cSanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba, you have proved that you are fine horsemen. Do something different each one of you, so that we can decide who will be Tunggi Ningthou.\u201d\r\nSuddenly, Sanajaoba mounted his horse and held his spear straight in front of him. He looked around. There was a hush among people. \u201cWhat is Sanajaoba, the eldest, going to do? They thought to themselves.\r\nSanajaoba then looked at the huge khongnang standing majestically in the distance. He pierced the tree and jumped his horse right through it!\r\n\u201cBravo! Bravo!\u201d The people shouted. \u201cThouro! Thouro!\u201d And then they fell silent.\r\nNow it was the turn of the second son, Sanayaima. What would he do? Sanayaima too looked at the khongnang as he mounted his horse. Then he too rode towards the tree, harder and harder. The people watched in silence, afraid even to breathe. When he was really close, he urged his horse to jump. Higher and higher the horse rose until horse and rider jumped clear over the huge tree and landed on the other side in a wonderful motion.\r\nThe people breathed in relief and said in unison: \u201cPhajei ! Phajei ! Wonderful ! Wonderful !\r\nAnd now, it was the turn of the youngest son, Sanatomba. He, too, rode his horse towards the khongnang and, before anybody knew what was happening, uprooted it. Triumphantly he carried the tree to the Ningthou and Leima and laid it at their feet! \r\nShouts of Thouro ! Thouro ! Phajei ! Phajei !\u201d filled the mountains.\r\nThe people grew restless. Why were the Ningthou and the Leima taking so long to make the announcement? They craned their necks to see what was happening.\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima were watching Sanatombi, their five year-old daughter. She looked sad and lonely. She stared at the khongnang which lay dead by the throne. Birds flapped worriedly around, searching for their homes in the tree. Sanatombi walked up to the khongnang and whispered, \u201cThe khongnang is dead. It was hurt by the spear and now it is dead.\u201d\r\nThe people were all attention. The Ningthou stood up. He looked at the three boys. He looked at the little girl. He turned to the people. \u201cIf anybody is worthy of becoming the ruler,\u201d he said, \u201cit is little Sanatombi. It was she who told us to look at the soul of the khongnang. Sanatombi feels the pain of others. She feels the pain of the people, the animals, the birds, the trees.\u201d\r\n\u201dI declare Sanatombi the future Leima of Kangleipak,\u201d\r\nthe Ningthou said. A silence fell. Everyone turned to look at the little girl, their future queen. There she stood, all of five, like a small khongnang, with birds flying all around her. They sat on her shoulders and on her head. She held out her hands full of grain and the birds flapped about her, pecking at the food.\r\n\u201cA Leima is one who doesn\u2019t hurt anybody in the kingdom.\u201d\r\n",

        "content": "Natha was the son of a rich landlord.\r\nHis father left him large tracts of land when he died. But Rama Natha did not spend even one day looking after his land. This was because he had a funny idea\u2014he believed there was a magic potion that could turn any object into gold. He spent all his time to learn more about this potion. People cheated him often, promising to tell him about it, but he did not give up. His wife, Madhumati, was tired of this and also worried because she saw how much money Rama Natha was spending. She was sure that soon they would be without money.\r\nOne day, a famous sage called Mahipati came to their town. Rama Natha became his follower and asked him about the potion. To his surprise the sage answered, \u201cYes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult.\u201d\r\n\u201cTell me!\u201d requested Rama Natha, not believing his luck.\r\n\u201cYou have to plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, the morning dew is on the leaves. You have to collect the dew and store it in a bottle. When you have five litres of dew, bring it to me. I will chant some magic words, which will turn it into the magic potion. A drop of the potion will change any object into gold.\u201d\r\nRama Natha was worried. \u201cBut winter is only for a few months. It will take me years to collect five litres of dew.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou can plant as many banana plants as you want. But remember, you must look after them yourself and collect the dew with your own hands.\u201dRama Natha went home, and after talking to his wife started cleaning his large fields, which had been lying empty all these years. There he planted rows and rows of banana plants. He tended them carefully and during the winter months collected the dew that formed on them with great care. His wife helped him too.\r\nMadhumati gathered the banana crop, took it to the market and got a good price for it. Over the years, Rama Natha planted more and more plants and they had a huge banana plantation.\r\nAt the end of six years, he finally had his five litres of dew.Carefully, he took the bottle to the sage. The\r\nsage smiled and muttered something over the water. Then he returned the bottle and said, \u201cTry it out.\u201d Rama Natha sprinkled a few drops on a copper vessel and waited for it to turn to gold. To his surprise nothing happened!\r\n\u201cThis is cheating,\u201d he told the sage. \u201cI have wasted six precious years of my life.\u201d\r\nBut sage Mahipati only smiled and called Madhumati to come forward. She came with a big box. When she opened it, inside shined stacks of gold coins!\r\nNow the sage turned to the very surprised Rama Natha and said, \u201cThere is no magic potion that can turn things into gold. You worked hard on your land and created this plantation.\r\nWhile you looked after the trees, your wife sold the fruits in the market. That\u2019s how you got this money. It was your hard work that created this wealth, not magic. If I had told you about this\r\nearlier, you would have not listened to me, so I have played a trick on you.\u201d\r\nRama Natha understood the wisdom behind these words and worked even harder on his plantation from that day on.",

The king was fond of Gajaraj,\r\nand he had ordered that the elephant should\r\nbe well looked after.\r\nIn spite of royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad\r\nbecause he had no friends. The mahout, or\r\nelephant trainer, was the only one he ever\r\ninteracted with. The mahout was a kind man\r\nwho served Gajaraj food, and gave him a bath\r\nin the elephant pond daily. He was a good\r\ncaretaker, but not a friend.\r\n\u201cI wish I had a friend I can play with,\u201d\r\nthought Gajaraj. One late evening, a dog\r\nstrayed into the stable. Gajaraj could see that\r\nthe visitor was tired and hungry. He pushed\r\nsome of the food he was munching towards the dog. The visitor wagged his tail, looked up at the elephant to convey his thanks, and then turned his full attention to the food in front of him. As soon as he finished eating, he fell asleep.The next morning, the mahout found the stray dog in the stable. He did not mind the dog. He also noticed that Gajaraj seemed to like the company. So, he threw some crumbs to the dog, which the animal accepted wagging his tail.When the elephant went out for a bath, the dog accompanied his friend. Plunging into the water, the elephant gave himself a shower using his long trunk, as the dog watched. The elephant took a trunkful of water and playfully splashed the water on his friend. The dog yelped for he hated taking showers. The mahout laughed.On their way home, the elephant picked up\r\nthe dog with his trunk and placed him on his\r\nback. The dog was delighted to get a ride.\r\nA farmer passing by saw the dog. \u201cBuntee,\u201d\r\nhe yelled. The dog ran to him. The farmer\r\nhugged the dog and told the mahout that he was\r\nlooking for his dog ever since he disappeared\r\nfrom his house. He was glad he found him now.\r\nThe mahout had no objection to the farmer\r\ntaking the dog home. The farmer tossed a\r\nrope round the neck of the dog, saying, \u201cCome\r\nBuntee, let\u2019s go home.\u201d On their way home, the elephant picked up\r\nthe dog with his trunk and placed him on his\r\nback.

He yelped, the elephant winced, but neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were in tears.\r\nThe next day at lunch time the mahout served Gajaraj his favourite food. When the mahout came back after finishing his other chores, he was surprised to see that the food had remained untouched.\u201cWhy Gajaraj, aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d he asked concerned. The elephant did not react. \u201cHe may have slight indigestion. Let me not force him to eat,\u201d thought the mahout.\r\nThat night too, Gajaraj did not touch his food\u2014nor the next day. Now, the mahout was worried. He ran his hand on Gajaraj\u2019s tummy and felt there was nothing wrong. \u201cWhy was he not eating then? Is he missing his friend, that dog?\u201d the mahout wondered.\r\nMeanwhile at the farmer\u2019s house, the dog had also not touched his food ever since he was brought home.\r\n\u201cAre you missing your friend?\u201d asked the farmer remembering the happy look on Buntee\u2019s face while sitting on the elephant\u2019s back. \u201cI cannot see you go hungry,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cIf you miss your friend so much, go to him.\u201d\r\nThe farmer removed the rope with which he had tied the dog. The dog, though weak,sprang to his feet. He licked the farmer\u2019s hand\r\nonce and then ran. He stopped only when he\r\narrived at the stable.\r\nThe elephant picked up the dog with his\r\ntrunk and gave him a joyous swing. The\r\nmahout was relieved. He quickly brought the\r\nfood. \u201cBoth of you eat first,\u201d he said.\r\nBy then the farmer who had followed the\r\ndog, joined him. The two of them watched\r\nwith satisfaction the two friends eating food.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only Gajaraj who has found a friend,\u201d\r\nsaid the mahout hugging the farmer, \u201cI\u2019ve also\r\nfound one.\u201d",

He showed off a lot,\r\nalways talking about how many friends he\r\nhad at school, and how he was so friendly with\r\neveryone.\r\nOne day his grandfather said to him, \u201cMario,\r\nI bet you a fruit chaat. You don\u2019t have as many\r\nfriends as you think you have. I\u2019m sure many\r\nof them are nothing more than companions or\r\npartners.\u201d\r\nMario accepted the bet readily. However,\r\nhe wasn\u2019t sure how he could test whether his\r\nschoolmates were real friends or not. So, he\r\nasked his grandpa for help. He suggested, \u201cI\r\nhave exactly what you need. It\u2019s in the attic.\r\nWait here a minute.\u201d\r\nGrandpa left, soon returning as though\r\ncarrying something in his hand, but Mario\r\ncould see nothing there.\r\n\u201cTake it. It\u2019s a very special chair. As it\u2019s\r\ninvisible, it\u2019s rather tricky to sit on it. But if you\r\ntake it to school and manage to sit on it, then the magic will work and you\u2019ll be able to tell who your real friends are.\u201d\r\nMario, brave and determined, took the strange invisible chair and set off for school. At break time, he asked everyone to form a circle. He put himself in the middle, with his chair.\r\n\u201cNobody move. You\u2019re about to see something amazing.\u201d Mario tried sitting on the chair. Having\r\ndifficulty seeing it, he missed and fell straight\r\nonto his backside. His classmates had a pretty\r\ngood laugh.\r\n\u201cWait, wait, just a slight technical\r\nproblem,\u201d he said, trying again. But again,\r\nhe missed the seat, causing more surprised\r\nlooks and laughter. Mario wouldn\u2019t give up.\r\nHe kept trying to sit on the magic chair and\r\nkept falling to the ground until, suddenly, he\r\ntried again and didn\u2019t fall. This time he sat,\r\nhanging in mid-air.\r\nThen he finally experienced the magic\r\nthat his grandfather had been talking about.\r\nLooking around, Mario saw Guneet, Asma, and\r\nDeepa\u2013three of his buddies\u2014holding him up,\r\nso he wouldn\u2019t fall. Meanwhile, many others he\u2019d thought of as friends had done nothing but made fun of him, enjoying each and every fall.\r\nLeaving with his three friends, he explained to them how his grandfather had so cleverly thought of a way to show him that true friends are those who care for us. A friend wouldn\u2019t be someone who takes joy in our bad luck.\r\nThat evening the four children went to see Mario\u2019s grandpa as he had won the bet. They had a great time listening to stories and eating a lot of fruit chaat. From then on, they used the magic chair test on many occasions and whoever passed became friends for life.",

I was born millions of years ago\r\nsomewhere in North India or Myanmar. Soon, my\r\nfamily spread outside India.\r\nAmber : Outside India? Where else can neem be found?\r\nNeem Baba : My family can be found in many Asian and African\r\ncountries and even in some parts of America.\r\nAmber : That\u2019s wonderful! Who gave you your name?\r\nNeem Baba : The story of my name is very\r\nthought-provoking. I was born\r\nin India and given Sanskrit\r\nnames such as Arishta (the one\r\nwho cures diseases), Nimba and\r\nNimbaca. The name \u2018Neem\u2019 is\r\ngiven by the Iranians.\r\nAmber : Really?\r\nNeem Baba : Yes, in Hindi, my name is Nimb.

That is\r\nwonderful.\r\nNeem Baba : Dear Amber, we become well\r\nknown for what we do. People\r\nfind us useful and that is why\r\nthey know us. Scientists call us\r\n\u2018bitter grace of God\u2019, \u2018nature\u2019s gift\r\nto man\u2019, and \u2018cleanliness-parting\r\ntree\u2019. Some even call us \u2018magic\r\ntree\u2019 and \u2018the tree of the twentieth\r\ncentury\u2019.\r\nAmber : I know that people clean teeth\r\nwith your twigs and protect\r\nclothes with your leaves.\r\nSometime back, when my brother\r\nhad measles, the doctor told us to\r\nput neem leaves on his bed and\r\nmake him lie down on them. Can\r\nyou explain why?\r\nNeem Baba : The doctors know that neem\r\nleaves have chemical properties\r\nthat destroy germs. Measles\r\ncause itching all over the body.\r\nNeem leaves give comfort and do\r\nnot allow germs to breed. Neem\r\nleaves, bark, flowers, fruits and\r\neven roots can be used to make\r\nmedicines to cure many diseases.\r\nAmber : Yes, I once had a cough and I\r\ncould not breathe properly. My\r\ngrandmother cured me with a\r\nmedicine made from neem bark.\r\nAnd when my father had itching\r\nin the eyes, she prepared a kajal\r\nfrom neem flowers, which cured\r\nhim.\r\nNeem Baba : Oh, little Amber, you know so\r\nmuch. Remember, these remedies\r\nare to be used only by people who\r\nare well trained and have a lot of\r\nexperience.\r\nAmber : Yes, I will. Tell me Neem Baba,\r\nis there any use of neem for the\r\nfarmers?\r\nNeem Baba : Yes. If the powder of neem seeds\r\nis mixed in water and sprayed\r\non plants and trees, then locusts\r\ndon\u2019t eat them. If it is used in\r\nrice fields, where water remains\r\nstanding, it stops mosquito\r\nbreeding and helps to increase\r\ncrop yield. It also saves the crop\r\nfrom termites, which eat roots\r\nof the crop, and it also stops\r\nbreeding of other insects that eat\r\ncrops.\r\nAmber : That means, if we put the powder\r\nof neem seeds in stagnant water\r\naround our homes, mosquitoes won\u2019t breed in them! This must\r\nbe a cost-effective method to stop\r\nmosquitoes from breeding. Please\r\ntell me other uses of neem in our\r\ndaily life.\r\nNeem Baba : Of course. People save their stored\r\ngrains from insects by adding\r\nneem seed powder to them. Neem\r\noil is also used to make soaps\r\nand toothpaste. Furniture made\r\nfrom neem wood is not eaten\r\nby termites. Neem also purifies\r\nthe air. There are many qualities\r\nyet to be discovered. Will you\r\ndiscover them when you grow\r\nup?\r\nAmber : Yes, Neem Baba. I will. Thank you\r\nfor your time today!\r\nNeem Baba : Bless you, my child!",

        "content": "Prabhat always wanted to win. His parents,\r\nteachers, and friends said that he did not\r\nknow how to accept defeat. The fact was that\r\nhe could not bear losing, not even at marbles.\r\nHe felt so good when he won that he never\r\nwanted to give up that feeling. On the contrary,\r\nlosing made him feel terrible. He thought that\r\nlosing was the worst thing that could happen\r\nto anyone.\r\nIf Prabhat sensed that he would lose a game,\r\nhe would not play it. He would take part only\r\nwhen he was sure of winning, even if the game\r\nlasted only for a minute. You could not stop\r\nhim from playing the kind of games he was\r\nreally good at, like badminton.\r\nA new student joined Prabhat\u2019s school, and\r\nhis name was Surya. Surya was an excellent\r\nbadminton player. Prabhat waited for the last\r\nFriday of the month. Last Friday was significant.\r\nThis was when the coach conducted friendly\r\nmatches in the games period. The teams were\r\ndecided on Monday and it was no surprise\r\nwhen Prabhat and Surya were chosen to play\r\na round against each other. Prabhat was given\r\nthe responsibility of keeping score for their\r\nmatch. On one hand, Prabhat prepared for the\r\nmatch with great seriousness. Surya, on the\r\nother hand, seemed relaxed, not taking the\r\nthings seriously at all. He walked about the\r\nwhole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all\r\nsorts of things. But on Friday, at the badminton\r\ncourt, Surya was a real phenomenon. He won\r\npoints again and again, laughing and joking all\r\nthe time. However, Surya was paying so little\r\nattention to the match that Prabhat managed\r\nto change the scoreboard while his opponent\r\nwas looking elsewhere.\r\nPrabhat managed to win by cheating. He\r\nmade a big thing of his win, but it did not\r\nmatter to Surya.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun. We should play again some\r\nother time,\u201d said Surya.\r\nOn that day, everyone was discussing their game and how Prabhat\r\nhad played so well. Surprisingly, Prabhat could not sleep well that\r\nnight. He had won the game but he did not feel as happy as he\r\nusually did. What was surprising was that Surya did not feel bad\r\nabout losing. What was more surprising was that Prabhat saw\r\nSurya playing basketball the next day. Surya\r\nwas so hopeless at it that he could not score a\r\nbasket for ten minutes. Yet, he enjoyed playing\r\nthe game. His happy smile never left his face.\r\nPrabhat kept a close watch on Surya for\r\nsome days. He was great at some things,\r\nterrible at others but what was common was\r\nthe enjoyment. He enjoyed everything equally.\r\nAs Prabhat went on with his observation, he\r\nrealised that to enjoy a game, you did not need\r\na scoreboard to keep a tally of your scores.\r\nNeither did you have to worry about winning\r\nand losing. You needed to enjoy the game for\r\nits own sake. What matters is trying to do well,\r\nand enjoying every moment of it.\r\nPrabhat learnt something through the\r\nobservations every day, soon realising the\r\nchange in himself. He had even begun playing\r\nhide and seek, and felt sad whenever it was\r\nabout to end. He also started joking while\r\nplaying badminton. Soon, the other students\r\nstarted talking amongst themselves, \u201cGood fun\r\nplaying with Prabhat, that fellow definitely has\r\na great sporting spirit.\u201d ; ",

And our unity in diversity makes us the most wonderful country in the world.\u201d The teacher smiled at her as everyone clapped. Just then, Bala pointed out, \u201cLook!

It is made on floors\r\nand walls of puja rooms, and outside the main\r\ndoor of the home. It is an art form made by\r\nthe women in the family.

I am\r\nPriyaranjan from Odisha.\r\nMy tribe practises a\r\n4000-year-old metal craft\r\nnamed Dhokra. To begin,\r\nwe make a figure with\r\nclay, dry it, and cover\r\nit with a layer of wax.\r\nThen, we carve the fine\r\ndetails on the wax. After that, we cover the figure\r\nwith clay, and put it in the fire. The wax melts and\r\ncomes out of small openings. Next, brass scrap\r\nis melted and poured into the empty space. The\r\nliquid metal takes the same shape as the wax.\r\nFinally, we remove the outer layer of clay and\r\nfinish the metal figure as we want.\r\nSuprabhaatam! I am\r\nChitra from Kerala. I want\r\nto tell you about coconut\r\nshell craft. First, we clean\r\nthe outside and inside of a\r\nbrown coconut shell. After\r\nthat, we make it smooth by using sandpaper or\r\na machine. Then we give it the shape we want,\r\nand make it stable by fixing a base under it.\r\nAt last, we polish it using wood polish to make\r\nit shine. We make household things like bowls\r\nand even jewellery from the coconut shells. It\r\nis a biodegradable craft.\r\nSubhodayam! I am Balamurali from\r\nAndhra Pradesh. I\r\nwant to tell you about\r\nthe 400-year-old art\r\nof making toys in my\r\nvillage, Kondapalli.\r\nTo make the toys, we\r\ntake soft wood from\r\nthe nearby hills. After\r\nthat, we carve each part of the toy separately.\r\nThen, we use makku\u2014a paste of tamarind\r\nseed powder and sawdust to join the pieces\r\ntogether. Next, we add details and finish the\r\ntoys. Finally, we use oil and water-colours or\r\nvegetable dyes and enamel paints to colour\r\nthem.

        "content": "When you enter a tiny room in Moti Vavdi\r\nvillage, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, you will see\r\nlots of bright colours. There are many\r\nlovely things like cushions, bedcovers,\r\npillows, and more, with beautiful designs.\r\nIla Sachani, a wonderful lady with a big\r\nsmile, makes all these using a shiny needle\r\nto create these designs. She is very good at\r\nKathiawar embroidery\u2014a style that needs\r\na lot of skill.\r\nIla Sachani\u2019s journey began in the quiet\r\nsettings of Amreli, Gujarat, where she\r\nwas born into a farmer\u2019s family. From the\r\nbeginning, life presented its challenges,\r\nas Ila was born with her hands hanging\r\nloose by her sides. Unlike other children,\r\nshe could not use her hands in the usual\r\nway. While other small hands drew figures\r\nin the sand or plucked wild flowers, she\r\nwondered why she could not join them.\r\nShe too wanted to hold a chalk in her hands\r\nand draw figures on a slate.\r\nIla\u2019s mother and grandmother\r\nencouraged the little girl and\r\nwere single-minded to help her\r\novercome her challenge. They\r\nwere skilled in the traditional art\r\nof Kathiawar embroidery and\r\ndecided to share this art with Ila.\r\nThey taught her to create many beautiful patterns using her feet! It was\r\ncertainly not an easy task, but Ila accepted\r\nthe challenge with determination. Her\r\nparents also helped her learn to do things\r\nwith her legs, like eating and combing her\r\nhair.\r\nThreading a needle was hard, but Ila did\r\nnot give up and became an expert at a\r\nyoung age. Her younger brother and sister\r\nhelped her too. She learned many styles,\r\neven ones from outside Gujarat\u2014Kachhi,\r\nKashmiri, Lucknawi and others.\r\nFor Ila, embroidery became a way to express\r\nherself. At first, she crafted fine designs\r\nonly for her family and friends, who were\r\nawestruck by her talent. They talked about\r\nthose designs to others. Soon, the people in\r\nthe village, too, discovered Ila\u2019s special skill\r\nand the admiration for her work began to\r\nspread.\r\nWord reached the government office, in\r\nSurat. They were moved by Ila\u2019s story and\r\nimpressed by her work. They decided to\r\ndisplay some samples of her embroidery\r\nat a state exhibition. This experience\r\nopened new doors for Ila. People observed\r\nthe beauty woven by her feet and readily\r\npurchased the creations. Ila was no more a\r\nhidden talent, but famous!\r\nEncouraged by this popularity, Ila\r\nparticipated in more exhibitions, not just\r\nwithin the state but at the national level.\r\nShe received many awards and honours,\r\nnot just for her art but also the willpower\r\nand creativity that her work showed. Ila\r\nSachani, once a farmer\u2019s daughter facing a\r\ntough challenge, worked hard and became\r\na celebrated artist and receiver of the\r\nPresident\u2019s Medal.\r\nThe most important change for Ila was\r\nthe new independence. Through her skill,\r\nshe not only earned a regular income but\r\nalso found joy in doing what she loved.\r\nShe proved, through her creations, that\r\nchallenges can be turned into victories\r\nwith focus, hard work, positivity and never\r\ngiving up. Her embroidery, created with her feet,\r\nreminds us that art has the power to rise\r\nabove physical boundaries and touch\r\nthe soul. ; ",

        "content": "The thought came to a certain king that\r\nhe would never fail if he knew three\r\nthings. These three things were: What is the right\r\ntime to begin something? Which people should\r\nhe listen to? What is the most important thing for\r\nhim to do?\r\nThe king, therefore, sent messengers\r\nthroughout his kingdom, promising a large sum\r\nof money to anyone who would answer these\r\nthree questions.\r\nMany wise men came to the king, but they all\r\nanswered his questions differently.\r\nIn reply to the first question, some said the\r\nking must prepare a timetable, and then follow it\r\nstrictly. Only in this way, they said, could he do\r\neverything at its proper time. Others said that it\r\nwas impossible to decide in advance the right time\r\nfor doing something. The king should notice all\r\nthat was going on, avoid foolish pleasures, and \r\nalways do whatever seemed necessary at that\r\ntime. Yet others said that the king needed a\r\ncouncil of wise men who would help him act at\r\nthe proper time. This was because one man\r\nwould find it impossible to decide correctly,\r\nwithout help from others, the right time for\r\nevery action.\r\nBut then others said that there were some\r\nthings which could be urgent. These things could\r\nnot wait for the decision of the council. In order\r\nto decide the right time for doing something, it is\r\nnecessary to look into the future. And only\r\nmagicians could do that. The king, therefore,\r\nwould have to go to magicians.\r\nIn their answers to the second question, some\r\nsaid that the people most necessary to the king\r\nwere his councillors; others said, the priests. A\r\nfew others chose the doctors. And yet others said\r\nthat his soldiers were the most necessary.\r\nTo the third question, some said science.\r\nOthers chose fighting, and yet others religious\r\nworship.\r\nAs the answers to his questions were so different,\r\nthe king was not satisfied and gave no reward.\r\nInstead, he decided to seek the advice of a certain\r\nhermit, who was widely known for his wisdom.\r\nThe hermit lived in a wood which he never\r\nleft. He saw no one but simple people, and so the\r\nking put on ordinary clothes. Before he reached\r\nthe hermit\u2019s hut the king left his horse with his\r\nbodyguard, and went on alone.\r\nAs the king came near the hermit\u2019s hut, he\r\nsaw the hermit digging the ground in front of his\r\nhut. He greeted the king and continued digging.\r\nThe hermit was old and weak, and as he worked,\r\nhe breathed heavily.\r\nThe king went up to the hermit and said, \u201cI\r\nhave come to you, wise hermit, to ask you to\r\nanswer three questions: How can I learn to do\r\nthe right thing at the right time? Who are the\r\npeople I need most? And what affairs are the\r\nmost important?\u201d\r\nThe hermit listened to the king, but did not\r\nspeak. He went on digging. \u201cYou are tired,\u201d said\r\nthe king. \u201cLet me take the spade and work in your\r\nplace.\u201d\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said the hermit, giving the king his\r\nspade. Then he sat down on the ground.\r\nWhen the king had dug two beds, he stopped\r\nand repeated his questions. The hermit gave no\r\nanswer, but stood up, stretching out his hand for\r\nthe spade, and said, \u201cNow you rest, and let me work.\u201d\r\nBut the king did not give him the spade and\r\ncontinued to dig.\r\nOne hour passed, then another. The sun went\r\ndown behind the trees, and at last the king stuck\r\nthe spade into the ground and said, \u201cI came to\r\nyou, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If\r\nyou can give me no answer, tell me so and I will\r\nreturn home.\u201d\r\n\u201cHere comes someone running,\u201d said the hermit.\r\nThe king turned round and saw a bearded man\r\nrunning towards them. His hands were pressed\r\nagainst his stomach, from which blood was\r\nflowing. When he reached the king he fainted and\r\nfell to the ground. The king and the hermit \r\nremoved the man\u2019s clothing and found a large\r\nwound in his stomach. The king washed and\r\ncovered it with his handkerchief, but the blood\r\nwould not stop flowing. The king re-dressed the\r\nwound until at last the bleeding stopped.\r\nThe man felt better and asked for something\r\nto drink. The king brought fresh water and gave\r\nit to him. By this time the sun had set and the\r\nair was cool. The king with the hermit\u2019s help\r\ncarried the wounded man into the hut and laid\r\nhim on the bed. The man closed his eyes and\r\nlay quiet. The king, tired by his walk and the\r\nwork he had done, lay down on the floor and\r\nslept through the night. When he awoke, it was\r\nseveral minutes before he could remember \r\nwhere he was or who the strange bearded man\r\nlying on the bed was.\r\n\u201cForgive me!\u201d said the bearded man in a weak\r\nvoice, when he saw that the king was awake.\r\n\u201cI do not know you and have nothing to forgive\r\nyou for,\u201d said the king.\r\n\u201cYou do not know me, but I know you. I am\r\nthat enemy of yours who swore revenge on you,\r\nbecause you put my brother to death and seized\r\nmy property. I knew you had gone alone to see that\r\nhermit, and I made up my mind to kill you on your\r\nway home. But the day passed and you did not\r\nreturn. So I left my hiding-place, and I came upon\r\nyour bodyguard, who recognised me and wounded\r\nme. I escaped from him but I should have died if\r\nyou had not dressed my wounds. I wished to kill\r\nyou, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, I will\r\nserve you as your most faithful servant and will order\r\nmy sons to do the same. Forgive me!\u201d\r\nThe king was very happy to have made peace\r\nwith his enemy so easily, and to have won him\r\nover as a friend. He not only forgave him but said\r\nhe would send his servants and his own doctor\r\nto look after him, and he promised to give back\r\nthe man his property.\r\nLeaving the wounded man, the king went out\r\nof the hut and looked round for the hermit. Before\r\ngoing away he wished once more to get answers\r\nto his questions. The hermit was on his knees\r\nsowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the\r\nday before. The king went up to the hermit and\r\nsaid, \u201cFor the last time I beg you to answer my\r\nquestions, wise man.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou have already been answered!\u201d said the\r\nhermit still bending down to the ground and\r\nlooking up at the king as he stood before him.\r\n\u201cHow have I been answered? What do\r\nyou mean?\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you not see?\u201d replied the hermit. \u201cIf you\r\nhad not pitied my weakness yesterday and had\r\nnot dug these beds for me, you would have gone\r\naway. Then that man would have attacked you\r\nand you would have wished you had stayed with\r\nme. So the most important time was when you\r\nwere digging the beds. And I was the most\r\nimportant man, and to do me good was your most\r\nimportant business. Afterwards, when the man\r\nran to us, the most important time was when you\r\nwere caring for him, because if you had not\r\ndressed his wounds he would have died without\r\nhaving made peace with you. So he was the most\r\nimportant man, and what you did for him was\r\nyour most important business.\r\n\u201cRemember then, there is only one time that is\r\nimportant and that time is \u2018Now\u2019. It is the most\r\nimportant time because it is the only time we have\r\nany power to act.\r\n\u201cThe most necessary person is the person you\r\nare with at a particular moment, for no one knows\r\nwhat will happen in the future and whether we\r\nwill meet anyone else. The most important\r\nbusiness is to do that person good, because we\r\nwere sent into this world for that purpose alone.\u201d",

        "content": "A smiling Rukku Manni threw open the\r\ndoor. Ravi and Meena rushed out, and\r\nRavi pulled Mridu into the house. \u201cWait, let me take\r\noff my slippers,\u201d protested Mridu. She set them out\r\nneatly near a pair of large black ones. Those were\r\ngrey, actually, with dust. You could see the clear\r\nmark of every toe on the front part of each slipper.\r\nThe marks for the two big toes were long\r\nand scrawny.\r\nMridu didn\u2019t have much time to wonder about\r\nwhose slippers they were, because Ravi dragged\r\nher to the backyard, behind a thick bitter-berry\r\nbush. There, inside a torn football lined with\r\nsacking and filled with sand, lay a very small\r\nkitten, lapping up milk from a coconut half-shell.\r\n\u201cWe found him outside the gate this morning.\r\nHe was mewing and mewing, poor thing,\u201dsaid Meena.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. Amma says Paati will leave\r\nfor our Paddu Mama\u2019s house if she knows we\r\nhave a cat.\u201d\r\n\u201cPeople are always telling us to be kind to\r\nanimals, but when we are, they scream. \u2018Ooh,\r\ndon\u2019t bring that dirty creature here!\u2019 \u201d said Ravi.\r\n\u201cDo you know how hard it is just to get a little\r\nmilk from the kitchen? Paati saw me with a glass\r\nin my hand just now. I told her I\u2019m very hungry, I\r\nwant to drink it, but the way she looked at me! I\r\nhad to drink most of it to throw her off the scent.\r\nThen she wanted the tumbler back. \u2018Paati, Paati,\r\nI\u2019ll wash it myself, why should I put you to\r\ntrouble\u2019, I told her. I had to run and pour the\r\nmilk into this coconut shell and then run back\r\nand wash the tumbler and put it back before she\r\ngot really suspicious. Now we have to think of\r\nsome other way to feed Mahendran.\u201d\r\n\u201cMahendran? This little kitty\u2019s name is\r\nMahendran?\u201d Mridu was impressed! It was a real\r\nname\u2014not just a cute kitty-cat name.\r\n\u201cActually his full name is Mahendravarma\r\nPallava Poonai. M.P. Poonai for short if you like.\r\nHe\u2019s a fine breed of cat. Just look at his fur. Like a\r\nlion\u2019s mane! And you know what the emblem of\r\nthe ancient Pallava kings was, don\u2019t you?\u201d he\r\nlooked expectantly at Mridu.\r\nMridu giggled.\r\n\u201cThink I\u2019m joking? Well, just wait. I\u2019ll show\r\nyou sometime. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t know a thing\r\nabout history. Haven\u2019t been to Mahabalipuram,\r\nhave you?\u201d he said mysteriously. \u201cWell, when\r\nour class went to Mahabalipuram, I saw a statue\r\nof his thatha\u2019s thatha\u2019s thatha\u2019s thatha\u2019s\r\nthatha\u2019s... etcetera, etcetera... Fact is, Mahendran\r\nhere is descended from that very same\r\nancient cat. A close relative, scientifically\r\nspeaking, of none other than the lion. The Pallava\r\nlion, emblem of the Pallava dynasty!\u201d Ravi\r\nwent on, walking around the bitter-berry bush,\r\nwaving a twig up and down, his eyes sparkling.\r\n\u201cThis cat is a descendant of none other than the\r\nMahabalipuram Rishi-Cat! And if I may\r\njust remind you, they worshipped cats in\r\nancient Egypt!\u201d\r\nHow he loved the sound of his own voice!\r\nMeena and Mridu exchanged looks.\r\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d\r\nMridu demanded.\r\n\u201cHuh! I\u2019m telling you this cat is descended...\r\nfrom the Egyptian cat-god... no, goddess! Bastet!\r\nYa! That\u2019s it!\u201d\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, one of the descendants of that cat-goddess\r\nwas a stowaway in one of the Pallava ships, and his\r\ndescendant was the Mahabalipuram Rishi-Cat,\r\nwhose descendant is \u2014\u201d Ravi flourished his twig at\r\nMahendran \u201c\u2014 M.P. Poonai here... whoop EEK!\u201d he\r\nshrieked, very pleased with himself.\r\nMahendran looked up, alarmed. He had just\r\nbeen sharpening his claws on the edge of the\r\ncoconut shell. But worse than Ravi\u2019s awful\r\nwhoop EEK was a \u2018Kreech...!\u2019 from the window.\r\nWhat a weird sound! If Mridu was startled,\r\nM.P. Poonai was frightened out of his wits.\r\nHair standing on end, he bounced up and\r\nscurried towards a bamboo tray of red chillies\r\nthat had been set out to dry. Trying to hide\r\nbeneath it, he tipped a few chillies over himself.\r\n\u201cMi-a-aw!\u201d he howled miserably.\r\nThe \u2018kreeching\u2019 went on and on. \u201cWhat\u2019s that\r\nnoise?\u201d said Mridu.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Lalli learning to play the violin,\u201d\r\ngrunted Ravi.\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll never learn a thing. The musicmaster\r\njust goes on playing like a train\r\nwhizzing on and on, while Lalli\u2019s all the time\r\nderailing! Going completely off track!\u201d\r\nMridu crept up to the window. Lalli was sitting a\r\nlittle distance away, awkwardly holding her violin\r\nand bowstring, her elbows jutting out and her eyes\r\nglazed with concentration. In front of her, with most\r\nof his back to the window, was the bony figure of\r\nthe music-master. He had a mostly bald head with\r\na fringe of oiled black hair falling around his ears\r\nand an old-fashioned tuft. A gold chain gleamed\r\naround his leathery neck, and a diamond ring\r\nglittered on his hand as it glided up and down the\r\nstem of the violin. A large foot stuck out from beneath\r\nhis gold-bordered veshti edge, and he was beating\r\ntime on the floor with the scrawny big toe.\r\nHe played a few notes. Lalli stumbled behind\r\nhim on her violin, which looked quite helpless\r\nand unhappy in her hands. What a difference!\r\nThe music-master\u2019s notes seemed to float up and\r\nsettle perfectly into the invisible tracks of the\r\nmelody. It was like the wheels of a train fitting\r\nsmoothly into the rails and whizzing along, as Ravi\r\nsaid. Mridu stared at that huge, beringed hand\r\nmoving effortlessly up the violin\u2019s stem, making\r\nlovely music.\r\nSquawk! There was Lalli derailing again!\r\n\u201cAmma!\u201d came a wail from the gate. \u201cAmmaoh!\u201d\r\n\u201cRavi, send that beggar away!\u201d cried his mother\r\nfrom the back verandah, where she was chatting\r\nwith Tapi. \u201cHe has been coming here every day for\r\nthe past week, and it\u2019s time he found another house\r\nto beg from!\u201d Paati explained to Tapi.\r\nMridu and Meena followed Ravi out. The\r\nbeggar was already in the garden, making himself\r\nquite at home. He had spread his upper cloth\r\nunder the neem tree, and was leaning against its\r\ntrunk, apparently prepared to take a little snooze\r\nwhile he waited for the alms to appear. \u201cGo away!\u201d\r\nsaid Ravi sternly. \u201cMy Paati says it\u2019s time you\r\nfound another house to beg from!\u201d\r\nThe beggar opened his eyes very wide and\r\ngazed at each of the children one by one. \u201cThe\r\nladies of this house,\u201d he said, at last, in a voice\r\nchoked with feeling, \u201care very kind souls. I have\r\nkept my body and soul together on their\r\ngenerosity for a whole week. I cannot believe that\r\nthey would turn me away.\u201d He raised his voice.\r\n\u201cAmma! Amma-oh!\u201d Sad his wail might be, but it\r\ncertainly wasn\u2019t feeble. It began in a deep, strong\r\nrumble somewhere in his withered belly, and came\r\nbooming out of his mouth, with its few remaining\r\nteeth stained brown with betel-chewing.\r\n\u201cRavi, tell him there\u2019s nothing left in the\r\nkitchen!\u201d called Rukku Manni. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not to\r\ncome again\u2014tell him that!\u201d She sounded fed up.\r\nRavi didn\u2019t have to repeat it all to the beggar.\r\nWhat his mother said had been easy for them all\r\nto hear, there under the neem tree. The beggar\r\nsat up and sighed.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go!\u201d he said wearily. \u201cOnly let me have\r\na rest here under this tree. The sun is so hot, the tar\r\nhas melted on the road. My feet are already\r\nblistered.\u201d He stretched out his feet to show large,\r\npink, peeling blisters on the soles of his bare feet.\r\n\u201cI suppose he doesn\u2019t have the money to buy\r\nchappals,\u201d Mridu whispered to Meena\u2013Ravi.\r\n\u201cHave you got an old pair in the house\r\nsomewhere?\u201d\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ravi. \u201cMine are too small\r\nto fit his feet, or I\u2019d have given them to him.\u201d And\r\nhis feet were larger than Mridu\u2019s and Meena\u2019s.\r\nThe beggar was shaking out his upper cloth\r\nand tightening his dhoti. He raised his eyes and\r\nlooked fearfully at the road, gleaming in the\r\nafternoon heat.\r\n\u201cHe needs something on his feet!\u201d Meena said,\r\nher big eyes filling. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d\r\n\u201cSsh!\u201d said Ravi. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it!\r\nBlubbering, \u2018it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair\u2019 isn\u2019t going to\r\nhelp. In two minutes he\u2019ll be frying his feet on\r\nthat road. What he needs is a pair of chappals.\r\nSo where do we get them? Come, let\u2019s search\r\nthe house.\u201d He pushed Mridu and Meena into\r\nthe house.\r\nJust as she stepped into the verandah,\r\nMridu\u2019s eyes fell on the odd-looking chappals\r\nshe had noticed when she arrived.\r\n\u201cRavi!\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cWhose\r\nare those?\u201d\r\nRavi turned and glanced at the\r\nshabby-looking, but sturdy old slippers.\r\nHe beamed and nodded. \u201cThese are just\r\nthe right size,\u201d he said, picking them up.\r\nMridu and Meena followed him\r\nnervously back into the garden.\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d said Ravi to the beggar, dropping the\r\nslippers in front of the old man. \u201cWear these and\r\ndon\u2019t come back!\u201d The beggar stared at the\r\nslippers, hurriedly flung his towel over his\r\nshoulder, pushed his feet into them and left,\r\nmuttering a blessing to the children. In a minute\r\nhe had vanished around the corner of the street.\r\nThe music-master came out of the house and\r\ntook an unappreciative look at the three of them\r\nsitting quietly under the tree, playing marbles.\r\nThen he searched for his chappals in the\r\nverandah, where he had put them.\r\n\u201cLalli!\u201d he called, after a few moments. She\r\nhurried up to him. \u201cHave you seen my chappals,\r\nmy dear? I remember having kept them here!\u201d\r\nRavi, Mridu, and Meena silently watched Lalli\r\nand the music-master search every corner of the\r\nverandah. He scurried around, looking over the\r\nrailing and crouching near the flower pots to look\r\nbetween them. \u201cBrand new, they were! I went all\r\nthe way to Mount Road to buy them!\u201d he went on\r\nsaying. \u201cThey cost a whole month\u2019s fees, do you\r\nknow?\u201d\r\nSoon Lalli went in to tell her mother. Rukku\r\nManni appeared, looking harassed, with Paati\r\nfollowing her.\r\n\u201cWhere could they be? It\u2019s really quite\r\nupsetting to think someone might have stolen\r\nthem. So many vendors come to the door,\u201d\r\nworried Paati.\r\nRukku Manni caught sight of Ravi, Mridu,\r\nand Meena sitting under the tree. \u201cHave you\r\nchildren...\u201d she began, and then, seeing they were\r\ncuriously quiet, went on more slowly, \u201cseen anyone\r\nlurking around the verandah?\u201d A sharp V-shaped\r\nline had formed between her eyebrows. Another\r\nstraight, tighter one appeared in place of her\r\nusually soft, pleasant mouth. Rukku Manni was\r\nangry! thought Mridu with a shiver. She wouldn\u2019t\r\nbe so upset if she knew about the poor beggar\r\nwith sores on his feet, she tried to tell herself.\r\nTaking a deep breath, she cried, \u201cRukku\r\nManni, there was a beggar here. Poor thing, he\r\nhad such boils on his feet!\u201d\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Rukku Manni grimly, turning to\r\nRavi. \u201cYou gave the music-master\u2019s chappals to\r\nthat old beggar who turns up here?\u201d\r\n\u201cChildren these days...!\u201d groaned Paati.\r\n\u201cAmma, didn\u2019t you tell me about Karna who gave\r\naway everything he had, even his gold earrings, he\r\nwas so kind and generous?\u201d\r\n\u201cSilly!\u201d snapped Rukku Manni. \u201cKarna didn\u2019t\r\ngive away other people\u2019s things, he only gave away\r\nhis own.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut my chappals wouldn\u2019t have fitted the\r\nbeggar\u2019s feet...\u201d Ravi rushed brashly on, \u201cAnd\r\nAmma, if they did fit, would you really not\r\nhave minded?\u201d\r\n\u201cRavi!\u201d said Rukku Manni, very angry now.\r\n\u201cGo inside this minute.\u201d\r\nShe hurried indoors and brought out Gopu\r\nMama\u2019s hardly worn, new chappals. \u201cThese\r\nshould fit you, Sir. Please put these on. I am so\r\nsorry. My son has been very naughty.\u201d The musicmaster\u2019s\r\neyes lit up. He put them on, trying not to\r\nlook too happy. \u201cWell, I suppose these will have\r\nto do... These days children have no respect for\r\nelders, what to do? A Hanuman incarnate... only\r\nRama can save such a naughty fellow!\u201d Rukku\r\nManni\u2019s eyes flashed. She didn\u2019t seem to like Ravi\r\nbeing called a monkey, even a holy monkey. She\r\nstood stiff and straight by the front door. It was\r\nclear she wanted him to leave quickly.\r\nWhen he had clattered off in his new chappals,\r\nshe said, \u201cMridu, come in and have some tiffin.\r\nHonestly, how do you children think of such\r\nthings? Thank God your Gopu Mama doesn\u2019t wear\r\nhis chappals to work...\u201d As she walked towards\r\nthe kitchen with Mridu and Meena, she suddenly\r\nbegan to laugh. \u201cBut he\u2019s always in such a hurry\r\nto throw off his shoes and socks and get into his\r\nchappals as soon as he comes home. What\u2019s your\r\nMama going to say this evening when I tell him I\r\ngave his chappals to the music-master?\u201d",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "In n the good old days of the daimios,\r\nthere lived an old couple whose only\r\npet was a little dog. Having no children, they\r\nloved it as though it were a baby. The old dame\r\nmade it a cushion of blue crape, and at\r\nmealtime Muko\u2014for that was its name\u2014would\r\nsit on it as snug as any cat. The kind people fed\r\nthe pet with tidbits of fish from their own\r\nchopsticks, and all the boiled rice it wanted.\r\nThus treated, the dumb creature loved its\r\nprotectors like a being with a soul.\r\nThe old man, being a rice farmer, went daily\r\nwith hoe or spade into the fields, working hard\r\nfrom morning until O Tento Sama (as the sun\r\nis called) had gone down behind the hills. Every\r\nday the dog followed him to work, never once \r\nharming the white heron that walked in the\r\nfootsteps of the old man to pick up the worms.\r\nFor the old fellow was patient and kind to\r\neverything that had life, and often turned up a\r\nsod on purpose to give food to the birds.\r\nOne day the dog came running to him, putting\r\nhis paws against his legs and motioning with his\r\nhead to some spot behind. The old man at first\r\nthought his pet was only playing and did not mind\r\nit. But the dog kept on whining and running\r\nto and fro for some minutes. Then the old\r\nman followed the dog a few yards to a place where\r\nthe animal began a\r\nlively scratching.\r\nThinking it was\r\npossibly a buried\r\nbone or bit of fish,\r\nthe old man\r\nstruck his hoe in the earth,\r\nwhen, lo! a pile of gold gleamed\r\nbefore him.\r\nThus in an hour the old couple were made\r\nrich. The good souls bought a piece of land, made\r\na feast for their friends, and gave plentifully to\r\ntheir poor neighbours. As for the dog, they petted\r\nhim till they nearly smothered him with kindness.\r\nNow in the same village there lived a wicked\r\nold man and his wife, not a bit sensitive and kind,\r\nwho had always kicked and scolded all dogs\r\nwhenever any passed their house. Hearing of their\r\nneighbours\u2019 good luck, they coaxed the dog into\r\ntheir garden and set before him bits of fish and\r\nother dainties, hoping he would find treasure for\r\nthem. But the dog, being afraid of the cruel pair,\r\nwould neither eat nor move.\r\nThen they dragged him out of doors, taking a\r\nspade and hoe with them. No sooner had the dog\r\ngot near a pine tree growing in the garden than he\r\nbegan to paw and scratch the ground, as if a\r\nmighty treasure lay beneath.\r\n\u201cQuick, wife, hand me the spade and hoe!\u201d\r\ncried the greedy old fool, as he danced with joy.\r\nThen the covetous old fellow, with a spade,\r\nand the old crone, with a hoe, began to dig; but\r\nthere was nothing but a dead kitten, the smell of\r\nwhich made them drop their tools and shut their\r\nnoses. Furious at the dog, the old man kicked\r\nand beat him to death, and the old woman finished\r\nthe work by nearly chopping off his head with the\r\nsharp hoe. They then flung him into the hole and\r\nheaped the earth over his carcass.\r\nThe owner of the dog heard of the death of his\r\npet and, mourning for him as if he had been his\r\nown child, went at night under the pine tree. He\r\nset up some bamboo tubes in the ground, such\r\nas are used before tombs, in which he put fresh\r\nflowers. Then he laid a cup of water and a tray of\r\nfood on the grave and burned several costly sticks\r\nof incense. He mourned a great while over his\r\npet, calling him many dear names, as if he\r\nwere alive.\r\nThat night the spirit of the dog appeared to\r\nhim in a dream and said, \u201cCut down the pine tree\r\nover my grave, and make from it a mortar for your\r\nrice pastry and a mill for your bean sauce.\u201d\r\nSo the old man chopped down the tree and\r\ncut out of the middle of the trunk a section about\r\ntwo feet long. With great labour, partly by fire,\r\npartly by the chisel, he scraped out a hollow place\r\nas big as a small bowl. He then made a longhandled\r\nhammer of wood, such as is used for\r\npounding rice. When New Year\u2019s time drew near,\r\nhe wished to make some rice pastry. When the\r\nrice was all boiled, granny put it into the mortar,\r\nthe old man lifted his hammer to pound the mass\r\ninto dough, and the blows fell heavy and fast till\r\nthe pastry was all ready for baking. Suddenly\r\nthe whole mass turned into a heap of gold coins.\r\nWhen the old woman took the hand-mill, and\r\nfilling it with beans began to grind, the gold\r\ndropped like rain.\r\nMeanwhile the envious neighbour peeped\r\nin at the window when the boiled beans were\r\nbeing ground.\r\n\u201cGoody me!\u201d cried the old hag, as she saw\r\neach dripping of sauce turning into yellow gold,\r\nuntil in a few minutes the tub under the mill was\r\nfull of a shining mass of gold.\r\nSo the old couple were rich again. The next\r\nday the stingy and wicked neighbour came and\r\nborrowed the mortar and magic mill. They filled\r\none with boiled rice and the other with beans.\r\nThen the old man began to pound and the woman\r\nto grind. But at the first blow and turn, the pastry\r\nand sauce turned into a foul mass of worms. Still\r\nmore angry at this, they chopped the mill into\r\npieces, to use as firewood.\r\nNot long after that, the good old man dreamed\r\nagain, and the spirit of the dog spoke to him, telling\r\nhim how the wicked people had burned the mill\r\nmade from the pine tree. \u201cTake the ashes of the\r\nmill, sprinkle them on the withered trees, and they\r\nwill bloom again,\u201d said the dog-spirit.\r\nThe old man awoke and went at once to his\r\nwicked neighbour\u2019s house, where he found the\r\nmiserable old pair sitting at the edge of their\r\nsquare fireplace, in the middle of the floor,\r\nsmoking and spinning. From time to time they\r\nwarmed their hands and feet with the blaze from\r\nsome bits of the mill, while behind them lay a pile\r\nof the broken pieces.\r\nThe good old man humbly asked for the\r\nashes. Though the covetous couple turned up\r\ntheir noses at him and scolded him as if he were\r\na thief, they let him fill his basket with the ashes.\r\nOn coming home, the old man took his wife\r\ninto the garden. It being winter, their favourite\r\ncherry tree was bare. He sprinkled a pinch of\r\nashes on it, and, lo! it sprouted blossoms until it\r\nbecame a cloud of pink blooms which perfumed\r\nthe air. The news of this filled the village, and\r\neveryone ran out to see the wonder.\r\nThe covetous couple also heard the story, and,\r\ngathering up the remaining ashes of the mill, kept\r\nthem to make withered trees blossom.\r\nThe kind old man, hearing that his lord, the\r\ndaimio, was to pass along the high road near the\r\nvillage, set out to see him, taking his basket of\r\nashes. As the train approached, he climbed\r\nup into an old withered cherry tree that stood by\r\nthe wayside.\r\nNow, in the days of the daimios, it was the\r\ncustom, when their lord passed by, for all the loyal\r\npeople to shut up their high windows. They even\r\npasted them fast with a slip of paper, so as not to\r\ncommit the impertinence of looking down on his\r\nlordship. All the people along the road would fall\r\nupon their hands and knees and remain prostrate\r\nuntil the procession passed by.\r\nThe train drew near. One tall, competent man\r\nmarched ahead, crying out to the people by the\r\nway, \u201cGet down on your knees! Get down on your\r\nknees!\u201d And every one kneeled down while the\r\nprocession was passing.\r\nSuddenly the leader of the van caught sight\r\nof the aged man up in the tree. He was about to\r\ncall out to him in an angry tone, but, seeing he\r\nwas such an old fellow, he pretended not to notice\r\nhim and passed him by. So, when the daimio\u2019s\r\npalanquin drew near, the old man, taking a pinch\r\nof ashes from his basket, scattered it over the tree.\r\nIn a moment it burst into blossom.\r\nThe delighted daimio ordered the train to be\r\nstopped and got out to see the wonder. Calling\r\nthe old man to him, he thanked him and ordered\r\npresents of silk robes, sponge-cake, fans and\r\nother rewards to be given him. He even invited\r\nhim to his castle.\r\nSo the old man went gleefully home to share\r\nhis joy with his dear old wife.\r\nBut when the greedy neighbour heard of it,\r\nhe took some of the magic ashes and went out on\r\nthe highway. There he waited until a daimio\u2019s train\r\ncame along and, instead of kneeling down like\r\nthe crowd, he climbed a withered cherry tree.\r\nWhen the daimio himself was almost directly\r\nunder him, he threw a handful of ashes over the\r\ntree, which did not change a particle. The wind\r\nblew the fine dust in the noses and eyes of the\r\ndaimio and his wife. Such sneezing and choking!\r\nIt spoiled all the pomp and dignity of the\r\nprocession. The man whose business it was to\r\ncry, \u201cGet down on your knees,\u201d seized the old fool\r\nby the collar, dragged him from the tree, and\r\ntumbled him and his ash-basket into the ditch\r\nby the road. Then, beating him soundly, he left\r\nhim for dead.\r\nThus the wicked old man died in the mud, but\r\nthe kind friend of the dog dwelt in peace and plenty,\r\nand both he and his wife lived to a green old age.",

Maybe he\u2019s very poor and can\u2019t afford\r\nto eat.\u201d\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be poor if he\u2019s a crook on the run,\u201d I\r\ntold him. \u201cHe\u2019s probably got millions of rupees\r\nstashed away somewhere in that room.\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s a criminal, Maya? He\r\ndoesn\u2019t look like one,\u201d Nishad looked doubtful.\r\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s one, Seven,\u201d I said, \u201cand\r\nhe certainly isn\u2019t starving. Mr Mehta told us\r\nthat Ramesh brings his meals up from the\r\nrestaurant downstairs.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut Maya, Mr Mehta told us he doesn\u2019t work\r\nanywhere, so how can he possibly have money to\r\npay for food?\u201d Nishad said.\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe must have lots of\r\nmoney hidden somewhere, maybe in that trunk\r\nin his room. It\u2019s probably full of silver and gold\r\nand jewels and...\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat rubbish,\u201d Nishad interrupted.\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m right, stupid,\u201d I told him. \u201cBy the\r\nway, Seven, did you see his scars? I couldn\u2019t, it\r\nwas too dark, but I bet he got them during a shootout\r\nwith the police or something.\u201d\r\n\u201cMummy told us quite clearly they were burn\r\nscars,\u201d Nishad said firmly.\r\n\u201cPerhaps the police had to set his house\r\non fire to force him out,\u201d I suggested. Seven\r\nlooked unsure.\r\nOn the Monday following Mamma\u2019s birthday,\r\nSeven went alone with her to the clinic at Girgaum\r\nas I was spending the evening with a schoolfriend.\r\nWhen they returned, Nishad told me he\u2019d been to\r\nsee Mr Nath and I felt most annoyed that I hadn\u2019t\r\nbeen there.\r\nSeven had been quite upset about Mr Nath\u2019s\r\ngaunt appearance and was sure that he was\r\nstarving. He told me that he had knocked loudly\r\non Mr Nath\u2019s door that evening and said, \u201cOpen\r\nthe door quickly, Mr Nath.\u201d\r\nThe man had opened it and asked him, \u201cLost\r\nanother marble?\u201d\r\nHe had obviously recognised my brother.\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Nishad. He had taken the man\u2019s\r\nhand in his own, and thrust a bar of chocolate\r\ninto it.\r\n\u201cDid you get a chance to peek into the trunk,\r\nSeven?\u201d I asked.\r\nNishad looked disappointed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even\r\nask me in,\u201d he said. Then he smiled. \u201cBut I did\r\nfind out something, Maya. I went down to\r\nthe restaurant where Ramesh works and talked\r\nto him.\u201d\r\n\u201cGood for you, Mr Detective,\u201d I said, patting\r\nhim on the back, \u201cI hope you questioned him\r\nproperly.\u201d\r\nSeven looked pleased. \u201cRamesh told me that\r\nhe takes two meals for Mr Nath every morning\r\nand evening, and two cups of tea, one in the\r\nmorning and one in the afternoon. Ramesh says\r\nhe\u2019s not very particular about what he eats, it\u2019s\r\nalways the same food \u2014 two chapattis, some dal\r\nand a vegetable. Mr Nath pays cash and tips well.\r\n\u201cRamesh told me something very strange, Maya,\u201d\r\nSeven added. \u201cAlmost every Sunday, he carries two\r\nlunches to Mr Nath\u2019s room and the same man is\r\nwith him each time. He\u2019s tall, fair, stout and wears\r\nspectacles. Ramesh says his visitor talks a lot, unlike\r\nMr Nath who hardly speaks.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell done, Nishad,\u201d I told him. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve\r\nmade some progress with our inquiries, we\u2019ll have\r\nto sort out all the facts like expert detectives so\r\nthat we can trap the crook.\u201d\r\n\u201cHow you do go on, Maya,\u201d Seven sighed. \u201cHow\r\ncan you possibly imagine he\u2019s a crook? He looks\r\nso ordinary!\u201d\r\n\u201cCriminals can look quite ordinary, smarty,\u201d I\r\nretorted. \u201cDid you see the picture of the Hyderabadi\r\nhousebreaker in the papers yesterday? He\r\nlooked like any man on the street.\u201d Nishad\r\nlooked doubtful.\r\nThe monsoons broke the next day. Dark clouds\r\naccompanied by blinding flashes of lightning\r\nand roaring rolls of thunder burst with all\r\ntheir fury, flooding the streets with a heavy\r\ndownpour. School was to have reopened after the\r\nsummer holidays, but no traffic could move\r\nthrough the flooded roads and there was an\r\nunexpected holiday.\r\nI thought I\u2019d spend the time usefully. I sat at\r\nmy desk in our bedroom with a sheet of paper\r\nbefore me.\r\nI wrote in large block letters:\r\nCATCHING A CROOK\r\nExpert Detectives: Nishad and Maya Pandit\r\nBy Appointment to the Whole World\r\nThen I began writing. About half an hour later,\r\nI turned towards Seven who was lying on his\r\ntummy, chin cupped in his palms, reading\r\ncomics. \u201cWant to hear what I\u2019ve written?\u201d I asked\r\nHe looked up questioningly. \u201cI\u2019ve listed all the\r\nfacts we know about Mr Nath which might help\r\nus to trap him,\u201d I said. \u201cWant to hear?\u201d\r\nSeven nodded.\r\n\u201cFact Number1,\u201d I read, \u201chis name is Mr Nath.\r\nWe must discover his first name.\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s his real name, Maya?\u201d\r\nNishad asked.\r\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said. \u201cMost crooks have an\r\nalias.\u201d I added a big question mark after Nath.\r\n\u201cFact Number 2,\u201d I read on, \u201cthe tenants at\r\nShankar House say he\u2019s mad, strange and\r\nunfriendly.\r\n\u201cNumber 3, he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone and is\r\nmannerless.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut he did talk to us, Maya, and Mamma says\r\nhe\u2019s very polite,\u201d Nishad interrupted.\r\n\u201cHe only talked to us because he had to,\u201d I\r\nsaid, \u201cand since he was under Mamma\u2019s medical\r\ntreatment, he had to be polite.\r\n\u201cFact number 4, he doesn\u2019t receive any letters.\u201d\r\nSeven nodded.\r\n\u201cNumber 5, he\u2019s been living in Room 10 of\r\nShankar House for more than a year,\u201d I continued.\r\n\u201cNumber 6, he doesn\u2019t work and sits in his\r\nroom all day.\r\n\u201cNumber 7, the kids in Shankar House and\r\neven some of the grown-ups are scared of him.\r\n\u201cNumber 8, he has no visitors except for a\r\nspectacled, fair, fat man who visits him on\r\nSundays for lunch.\r\n\u201cNumber 9, food and tea are taken to his room\r\nby Ramesh from the restaurant downstairs. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t care what he eats, pays his bill immediately\r\nand tips well. That ends my list. Have I forgotten\r\nanything, Seven?\u201d\r\nNishad had obviously not been paying too\r\nmuch attention to my list of facts. All he could\r\nsay was, \u201cPoor man, Maya, he must be so lonely\r\nif he doesn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\r\n\u201cHow can a crook have friends, idiot?\u201d I\r\nalmost shouted.\r\n\u201cAt least he has one friend, the one who meets\r\nhim on Sundays,\u201d said Nishad.\r\nA brilliant thought occurred to me just then.\r\n\u201cThat man must be Mr Nath\u2019s accomplice in\r\ncrime,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe he keeps all the loot and he\r\ncomes now and then to give part of it to his partner,\r\nMr Nath, for expenses. That\u2019s it! I\u2019m sure I\u2019m right.\u201d\r\n\u201cIf you insist on calling him a criminal, I don\u2019t\r\nthink I want to discuss anything with you, Maya,\u201d\r\nsaid Nishad angrily. \u201cHe can\u2019t be such a bad man\r\nif he gives Ramesh such generous tips.\u201d\r\n\u201cRamesh probably knows something about his\r\npast, so Mr Nath must be bribing him to keep\r\nquiet,\u201d I said.\r\nNishad glared at me with his arms tightly\r\ncrossed across his chest. I was beginning to get\r\nfed up with him.\r\n\u201cHow can we make any progress with our\r\ninvestigations if you take that attitude, Seven?\u201d\r\nI asked.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll cooperate only if you give up this idea\r\nabout him being an escaped crook,\u201d said Seven.\r\n\u201cYou really make me angry.\u201d\r\nI almost hit him. \u201cI make you angry, you stupid\r\noaf,\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou make me mad! What is the\r\npoint of all these\r\nenquiries if he\u2019s not a\r\ncrook? If you think he\u2019s\r\na nobody, what\u2019s the\r\nidea of bothering about\r\nhim, please tell me?\u201d\r\nNishad looked\r\nthoughtful. \u201cI\u2019d like to\r\nfind out why he\u2019s so thin\r\nand why he\u2019s so lonely. I want to\r\nknow why he doesn\u2019t have any\r\nfriends and lives alone.\u201d\r\n\u201cTry to understand, Seven,\u201d I told\r\nhim, \u201cif he\u2019s lived in Shankar House\r\nfor a year and hasn\u2019t made a single\r\nfriend, there\u2019s something wrong.\r\nHe\u2019s obviously scared that someone\r\nwill recognise him and give him up to the cops.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe no one\u2019s tried to make friends with\r\nhim,\u201d\r\nNishad protested.\r\n\u201cWhy should anyone bother? You\u2019ve seen what\r\na nasty bear he is,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Nishad stubbornly, \u201cI like\r\nhim and I\u2019m going to try and be his friend.\u201d\r\n\u201cFriends with a crook! Ha! You\u2019re crazy,\r\nSeven,\u201dI said. \u201cThe cops will take you to jail with\r\nhim. Do you want that to happen, you idiot?\u201d\r\nNishad merely glared at me and quietly walked\r\nout of the room. My theories seemed to have made\r\nno impression on him at all.",

        "content": "As we walked back towards the clinic\r\nSeven said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look anything\r\nlike a monster, Maya. But did you see how thin\r\nhe is? Maybe he\u2019s very poor and can\u2019t afford\r\nto eat.\u201d\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be poor if he\u2019s a crook on the run,\u201d I\r\ntold him. \u201cHe\u2019s probably got millions of rupees\r\nstashed away somewhere in that room.\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s a criminal, Maya? He\r\ndoesn\u2019t look like one,\u201d Nishad looked doubtful.\r\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s one, Seven,\u201d I said, \u201cand\r\nhe certainly isn\u2019t starving. Mr Mehta told us\r\nthat Ramesh brings his meals up from the\r\nrestaurant downstairs.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut Maya, Mr Mehta told us he doesn\u2019t work\r\nanywhere, so how can he possibly have money to\r\npay for food?\u201d Nishad said.\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe must have lots of\r\nmoney hidden somewhere, maybe in that trunk\r\nin his room. It\u2019s probably full of silver and gold\r\nand jewels and...\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat rubbish,\u201d Nishad interrupted.\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m right, stupid,\u201d I told him. \u201cBy the\r\nway, Seven, did you see his scars? I couldn\u2019t, it\r\nwas too dark, but I bet he got them during a shootout\r\nwith the police or something.\u201d\r\n\u201cMummy told us quite clearly they were burn\r\nscars,\u201d Nishad said firmly.\r\n\u201cPerhaps the police had to set his house\r\non fire to force him out,\u201d I suggested. Seven\r\nlooked unsure.\r\nOn the Monday following Mamma\u2019s birthday,\r\nSeven went alone with her to the clinic at Girgaum\r\nas I was spending the evening with a schoolfriend.\r\nWhen they returned, Nishad told me he\u2019d been to\r\nsee Mr Nath and I felt most annoyed that I hadn\u2019t\r\nbeen there.\r\nSeven had been quite upset about Mr Nath\u2019s\r\ngaunt appearance and was sure that he was\r\nstarving. He told me that he had knocked loudly\r\non Mr Nath\u2019s door that evening and said, \u201cOpen\r\nthe door quickly, Mr Nath.\u201d\r\nThe man had opened it and asked him, \u201cLost\r\nanother marble?\u201d\r\nHe had obviously recognised my brother.\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Nishad. He had taken the man\u2019s\r\nhand in his own, and thrust a bar of chocolate\r\ninto it.\r\n\u201cDid you get a chance to peek into the trunk,\r\nSeven?\u201d I asked.\r\nNishad looked disappointed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even\r\nask me in,\u201d he said. Then he smiled. \u201cBut I did\r\nfind out something, Maya. I went down to\r\nthe restaurant where Ramesh works and talked\r\nto him.\u201d\r\n\u201cGood for you, Mr Detective,\u201d I said, patting\r\nhim on the back, \u201cI hope you questioned him\r\nproperly.\u201d\r\nSeven looked pleased. \u201cRamesh told me that\r\nhe takes two meals for Mr Nath every morning\r\nand evening, and two cups of tea, one in the\r\nmorning and one in the afternoon. Ramesh says\r\nhe\u2019s not very particular about what he eats, it\u2019s\r\nalways the same food \u2014 two chapattis, some dal\r\nand a vegetable. Mr Nath pays cash and tips well.\r\n\u201cRamesh told me something very strange, Maya,\u201d\r\nSeven added. \u201cAlmost every Sunday, he carries two\r\nlunches to Mr Nath\u2019s room and the same man is\r\nwith him each time. He\u2019s tall, fair, stout and wears\r\nspectacles. Ramesh says his visitor talks a lot, unlike\r\nMr Nath who hardly speaks.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell done, Nishad,\u201d I told him. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve\r\nmade some progress with our inquiries, we\u2019ll have\r\nto sort out all the facts like expert detectives so\r\nthat we can trap the crook.\u201d\r\n\u201cHow you do go on, Maya,\u201d Seven sighed. \u201cHow\r\ncan you possibly imagine he\u2019s a crook? He looks\r\nso ordinary!\u201d\r\n\u201cCriminals can look quite ordinary, smarty,\u201d I\r\nretorted. \u201cDid you see the picture of the Hyderabadi\r\nhousebreaker in the papers yesterday? He\r\nlooked like any man on the street.\u201d Nishad\r\nlooked doubtful.\r\nThe monsoons broke the next day. Dark clouds\r\naccompanied by blinding flashes of lightning\r\nand roaring rolls of thunder burst with all\r\ntheir fury, flooding the streets with a heavy\r\ndownpour. School was to have reopened after the\r\nsummer holidays, but no traffic could move\r\nthrough the flooded roads and there was an\r\nunexpected holiday.\r\nI thought I\u2019d spend the time usefully. I sat at\r\nmy desk in our bedroom with a sheet of paper\r\nbefore me.\r\nI wrote in large block letters:\r\nCATCHING A CROOK\r\nExpert Detectives: Nishad and Maya Pandit\r\nBy Appointment to the Whole World\r\nThen I began writing. About half an hour later,\r\nI turned towards Seven who was lying on his\r\ntummy, chin cupped in his palms, reading\r\ncomics. \u201cWant to hear what I\u2019ve written?\u201d I asked\r\nHe looked up questioningly. \u201cI\u2019ve listed all the\r\nfacts we know about Mr Nath which might help\r\nus to trap him,\u201d I said. \u201cWant to hear?\u201d\r\nSeven nodded.\r\n\u201cFact Number1,\u201d I read, \u201chis name is Mr Nath.\r\nWe must discover his first name.\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s his real name, Maya?\u201d\r\nNishad asked.\r\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said. \u201cMost crooks have an\r\nalias.\u201d I added a big question mark after Nath.\r\n\u201cFact Number 2,\u201d I read on, \u201cthe tenants at\r\nShankar House say he\u2019s mad, strange and\r\nunfriendly.\r\n\u201cNumber 3, he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone and is\r\nmannerless.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut he did talk to us, Maya, and Mamma says\r\nhe\u2019s very polite,\u201d Nishad interrupted.\r\n\u201cHe only talked to us because he had to,\u201d I\r\nsaid, \u201cand since he was under Mamma\u2019s medical\r\ntreatment, he had to be polite.\r\n\u201cFact number 4, he doesn\u2019t receive any letters.\u201d\r\nSeven nodded.\r\n\u201cNumber 5, he\u2019s been living in Room 10 of\r\nShankar House for more than a year,\u201d I continued.\r\n\u201cNumber 6, he doesn\u2019t work and sits in his\r\nroom all day.\r\n\u201cNumber 7, the kids in Shankar House and\r\neven some of the grown-ups are scared of him.\r\n\u201cNumber 8, he has no visitors except for a\r\nspectacled, fair, fat man who visits him on\r\nSundays for lunch.\r\n\u201cNumber 9, food and tea are taken to his room\r\nby Ramesh from the restaurant downstairs. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t care what he eats, pays his bill immediately\r\nand tips well. That ends my list. Have I forgotten\r\nanything, Seven?\u201d\r\nNishad had obviously not been paying too\r\nmuch attention to my list of facts. All he could\r\nsay was, \u201cPoor man, Maya, he must be so lonely\r\nif he doesn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\r\n\u201cHow can a crook have friends, idiot?\u201d I\r\nalmost shouted.\r\n\u201cAt least he has one friend, the one who meets\r\nhim on Sundays,\u201d said Nishad.\r\nA brilliant thought occurred to me just then.\r\n\u201cThat man must be Mr Nath\u2019s accomplice in\r\ncrime,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe he keeps all the loot and he\r\ncomes now and then to give part of it to his partner,\r\nMr Nath, for expenses. That\u2019s it! I\u2019m sure I\u2019m right.\u201d\r\n\u201cIf you insist on calling him a criminal, I don\u2019t\r\nthink I want to discuss anything with you, Maya,\u201d\r\nsaid Nishad angrily. \u201cHe can\u2019t be such a bad man\r\nif he gives Ramesh such generous tips.\u201d\r\n\u201cRamesh probably knows something about his\r\npast, so Mr Nath must be bribing him to keep\r\nquiet,\u201d I said.\r\nNishad glared at me with his arms tightly\r\ncrossed across his chest. I was beginning to get\r\nfed up with him.\r\n\u201cHow can we make any progress with our\r\ninvestigations if you take that attitude, Seven?\u201d\r\nI asked.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll cooperate only if you give up this idea\r\nabout him being an escaped crook,\u201d said Seven.\r\n\u201cYou really make me angry.\u201d\r\nI almost hit him. \u201cI make you angry, you stupid\r\noaf,\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou make me mad! What is the\r\npoint of all these\r\nenquiries if he\u2019s not a\r\ncrook? If you think he\u2019s\r\na nobody, what\u2019s the\r\nidea of bothering about\r\nhim, please tell me?\u201d\r\nNishad looked\r\nthoughtful. \u201cI\u2019d like to\r\nfind out why he\u2019s so thin\r\nand why he\u2019s so lonely. I want to\r\nknow why he doesn\u2019t have any\r\nfriends and lives alone.\u201d\r\n\u201cTry to understand, Seven,\u201d I told\r\nhim, \u201cif he\u2019s lived in Shankar House\r\nfor a year and hasn\u2019t made a single\r\nfriend, there\u2019s something wrong.\r\nHe\u2019s obviously scared that someone\r\nwill recognise him and give him up to the cops.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe no one\u2019s tried to make friends with\r\nhim,\u201d\r\nNishad protested.\r\n\u201cWhy should anyone bother? You\u2019ve seen what\r\na nasty bear he is,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Nishad stubbornly, \u201cI like\r\nhim and I\u2019m going to try and be his friend.\u201d\r\n\u201cFriends with a crook! Ha! You\u2019re crazy,\r\nSeven,\u201dI said. \u201cThe cops will take you to jail with\r\nhim. Do you want that to happen, you idiot?\u201d\r\nNishad merely glared at me and quietly walked\r\nout of the room. My theories seemed to have made\r\nno impression on him at all.",

You can find\r\nBristlecone Pines on Wheeler Peak today that\r\nare over 4000 years old! This is fact, Charlie.

I tracked down THE WHISTLE-PIG, THE\r\nBOBOLINK, THE SKROCK, THE POLLYFROG, THE\r\nGIANT CURLICUE, THE STINGING SLUG AND THE\r\nVENOMOUS SQUERKLE who can spit poison right\r\ninto your eye from fifty yards away.

        "content": "Soumya K.\r\nHouse No\u2026, Jayanagar,\r\nBengaluru\r\nDate: 14 April 2022\r\nDear Ananda,\r\nHope you are all doing well!\r\nDo you remember our last conversation about\r\n\u2018war and peace\u2019? We talked about how India had\r\nto struggle for its Independence from the British\r\nfor many centuries. Post-independence our\r\ncountry has had to fight several wars to protect\r\nits borders, territorial integrity, and its people.\r\nThis made me wonder, who were these brave\r\nIndian people? They fought to protect our country\r\nand sacrificed their lives so that we could lead\r\nour lives in peace. What were their names? Where\r\ndid they come from? Does anyone remember\r\nanything about them?\r\nLast week I got the answers to some of my\r\nquestions during an educational trip to New Delhi\r\norganised by our school. You may recall, I was\r\nlooking forward to this trip and our visit to many\r\nplaces of historical and educational significance.\r\nI learnt several new and interesting things, and I\r\nam excited to share them with you.\r\nLet me begin by asking you to guess the name\r\nof the monument that I found most inspiring. Lets\r\nsee if you can guess? The construction of this\r\nmonument started in April 2018 and was\r\ncompleted in February 2019. It was envisioned\r\nand then inaugurated by India\u2019s Prime Minister\r\nShri Narendra Modi in February 2019. In terms\r\nof location and size, it is spread over 40 acres of\r\nland near the iconic India Gate. But more\r\nimportantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest\r\nIndians. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed! It\u2019s the \u2018National\r\nWar Memorial\u2019. Won\u2019t you say, a long desired\r\naspiration was fullfilled?\r\nOur visit to the National War Memorial began\r\nwith our teacher explaining that even after\r\nindependence, India has had to fight many wars\r\nto protect itself, and the freedom and security we\r\nenjoy today is because of the many brave men\r\nand women who have served in the Indian Armed\r\nForces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always\r\ntakes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers\r\nhave had to sacrifice their lives for the country\r\neven after our independence in 1947. This is what\r\nmakes monuments like the National War\r\nMemorial extremely important so that we should\r\nnever forget the cost of freedom. We are aware,\r\nalways, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt\r\nthat each brick of the memorial is called a tablet,\r\nand it bears the names of soldiers who fought for\r\nIndia and made the supreme sacrifice in different\r\nwars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China\r\nconflict of 1962, the Indo-Pak Wars in 1965 &\r\n1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are\r\n29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names\r\nof fallen soldiers have been etched.\r\nIt was heartening to know that our government\r\nhas recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our\r\nteacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who\r\nwere awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India\u2019s\r\nhighest wartime gallantry medal, for their service\r\nto the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir\r\nChakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC)\r\nand Shaurya Chakra (SC).\r\nMajor Somnath Sharma was posthumously\r\nawarded India\u2019s first PVC, in the Battle of Badgam\r\nin 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for\r\nexceptional gallantry during the India-China\r\nConflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of\r\n1965. Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service\r\nduring the U.N.Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.\r\nIn the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were\r\nawarded the PVC (posthumously) includes Lance\r\nNaik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh\r\nSekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal and\r\nMajor Hoshiar Singh. Some Navy personnel\r\nincluding Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also\r\nawarded MVC for their exemplary courage and\r\nleadership.\r\nThen the teacher shared with us the citation\r\nof Param Vir Chakra awardee Lance Naik Albert\r\nEkka. It touched my heart and also motivated\r\nme. We were awestruck and humbled by his\r\nbravery. I aspire to be courageous like him when\r\nI join the army!\r\nAs we continued our visit around the National\r\nWar Memorial, we came across another important\r\ninstallation called Amar Jawan Jyoti that\r\ncommemorates our soldiers. The name, as you\r\nmay have guessed, represents an immortal flame\r\nthat is kept ablaze all through the day and night\r\nto revere the sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the\r\nAmar Jawan Jyoti which also displayed a rifle\r\nand a helmet was alighted under the arch of India\r\nGate in January 1972 to commemorate India\u2019s\r\nvictory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971.\r\nThe National War Memorial now includes\r\nAmar Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk which is\r\nsurrounded by four chakras. During the\r\ninauguration, the Prime Minister lit a new flame\r\nto commemorate the fallen heroes. Later, the old\r\nflame at India Gate was also merged with the new\r\nflame at the National War Memorial. Here is a\r\npicture of the new Amar Jawan Jyoti if you haven\u2019t\r\nseen it. You can see the obelisk surrounded by\r\nwreaths that have been placed as a mark of\r\nrespect. The lighting design is planned in such a\r\nway that it transforms the monument\u2019s landscape\r\nas sunlight changes from dawn to dusk. It truly\r\nis a majestic site that filled me with pride for our\r\nnation. I was also overwhelmed by the\r\ninterminable flame as a metaphor for eternal\r\nstories of courage and valour.\r\nOur teacher also explained the significance of\r\nthe Chakras to us. I found it interesting and hence\r\nsharing with you.\r\nThe National War Memorial consists of 4\r\nconcentric circles which are known as Amar\r\nChakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra and Raksha\r\nChakra around a 15-meter-tall central obelisk\r\nwith the eternal flame\u2014 the Amar Jawan Jyoti.

Each tree\r\nrepresents the soldiers who ensure the territorial\r\nintegrity of the nation We spent the whole day, from morning to\r\nevening, at the National War Memorial and the\r\nsurrounding areas, marked by majestic lawns\r\nand grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were\r\nimmersed in the ambience that was solemn and\r\na reminder of what a free nation could achieve.\r\nThe overall environment created an emotive\r\nexperience that was visually inspiring. I felt as\r\nif I had developed bond with the place.\r\nI learnt a lot. But I also have to admit that the\r\nvarious discourses on the day brought tears to\r\nmy eyes. It was sad to think about the massive\r\ndevastation and loss of life caused by wars. It\r\nmotivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices\r\nof our heroes.\r\nAfter our visit, the class decided to make\r\npresentations on stories of valour of the brave\r\nhearts, we came across at the National War\r\nMemorial. We divided ourselves into five groups.\r\nWe are choosing martyrs to make presentations\r\ndepicting their courageous stories. Our teacher\r\nhas also advised us to share our experience\r\nduring the school assembly. I am delighted that\r\nall the students of our school will get to know\r\nabout the National War Memorial and the soldiers\r\nit commemorates.\r\nI am going to give a presentation on the story\r\nof Major Padmapani Acharya who fought for India\r\nin the 1999 Kargil War and was awarded the Maha\r\nVir Chakra.\r\nThe citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as\r\nfollows:\r\nBefore he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his\r\nfather that he wasn\u2019t afraid or scared about losing\r\nhis life while trying to protect the motherland.\r\nQuoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, he went on to say:\r\ngrks ok \u00e7kIL;fl LoxaZ ftRok ok Hkks{;ls eghe~A\r\nrLeknqf\u00d9k\"B dkSUrs; ;q\u00bck; \u00d1rfu'p;%AA2-37AA\r\nHato vaa praapsyasi svargam jitvaa vaa bhokshyase mahiim\r\nTasmaaduttishtha kaunteya yuddhaaya kritanischayah\r\nIf you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go\r\nto the celestial abodes, or you will gain victory and enjoy the\r\nkingdom on earth. Therefore arise with determination.\r\nO, son of Kunti, and be prepared to fight.\r\nHere is the website link for National War Memorial\r\nhttps://nationalwarmemorial.gov.in/. Share it\r\nwith your friends to learn more about it\r\nWe reached Bengaluru yesterday. I have\r\nwritten a long letter as I could not help sharing\r\nthis inspiring experience with you.\r\nGive my regards to your Mom and Dad. I miss\r\nyour Mom\u2019s Chhole Bhature. You know I am a\r\nfoodie! Say hello to Amit.\r\nYour friend,\r\nSoumya\r\n\r\n\r\nAnanda,\r\nHouse No\u2026., Sector \u2026\r\nChandigarh.\r\nDate: 24 April 2022\r\nDear Soumya,\r\nIt was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I\r\nenjoyed reading your experience of the visit to the\r\nNational War Memorial in Delhi, as well as your\r\nobservations and feelings during the visit. You\r\nreally have an eye for detail and being the sensitive\r\nperson that you are, you have been able to capture\r\nthe essence of the emotions associated with this\r\nMemorial.\r\nI was happy to hear that you got an opportunity\r\nto visit the National War Memorial. I have heard a\r\nlot about it. Some people might see a war\r\nmemorial as just a monument, statue, an edifice\r\nto celebrate a war or victory and commemorate\r\nthose who were martyred or injured in war. In my\r\nview, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for\r\nthe supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers\r\ndefending the sovereignty and integrity of the\r\ncountry. I feel motivated and I am seriously\r\nthinking of joining the Armed Forces for serving\r\nmy motherland.\r\nI also feel it is our duty to periodically visit\r\nsuch places to honour our valiant soldiers, who\r\nhave made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices\r\nenable us to walk freely in our country without\r\nfear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher\r\nand school to arrange this visit to give you all a\r\nchance to learn about India\u2019s heroes and also\r\npay your respect to them. The idea of your class\r\nto make a presentation at the school and making\r\nevery one a part of your experience is wonderful!\r\nBest of luck for your presentation, I hope it goes\r\nwell and motivates the school students to join\r\nthe Indian Armed Forces.\r\nYour letter has reminded me of a time when\r\nwe visited the war memorial in our city. If I\r\nremember correctly, the day was National Martyrs\r\nDay. While visiting one of Chandigarh\u2019s gardens\r\nwe saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea\r\nGarden in Sector 3. As we approached the garden,\r\nwe saw people offering flowers and prayers. We\r\njoined the group out of curiosity and quickly\r\nrealised that they were all there to pay respect to\r\nthe soldiers at the War Memorial.\r\nWhen I think back about my visit where\r\neveryone was dedicating flowers as a mark of\r\nrespect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the\r\nfollowing poem:\r\nPushp ki Abhilasha\r\nChah Nahi, Main Sur Bala\r\nKe Gehano Mein Goontha Jaaun,\r\nChaah Nahi, Premi Mala Mein\r\nBindh Pyaari Ko Lalchaaun!\r\nChaah Nahi, Samraato Ke Shav\r\nPar, He Hari, Dala Jaaun,\r\nChaah Nahi, Dewon Ke Sar Par\r\nChadhoon, Bhagya Par Itraun!\r\nMujhe Tod Lena, Banmali!\r\nUs Path Mein Tum Dena Phaink,\r\nMatra Bhoomi Per Sheesh Chadhane\r\nJis Path Jaayen Veer Anek!\r\n\u2013Makhanlal Chaturvedi\r\nI hope you like the poem. I must say, I was\r\ninspired by your idea of presenting the valourous\r\nstories of India\u2019s soldiers. There are so many stories of courage, bravery, and sacrifice which\r\nremind us that many of the challenges we face in\r\nour lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace\r\nin our country and the luxury of exchanging ideas\r\nwith our friends because our Armed Forces are\r\nalert and work hard to create that environment\r\nfor us. Very recently I read in the newspaper that\r\nCaptain Anuj Nayyar, MVC, an Indian Army\r\nofficer of the 17 Jat regiment was posthumously\r\nawarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India\u2019s second\r\nhighest gallantry award, for exemplary valour\r\nduring the Kargil War in 1999. I look forward to\r\nlearning more about him. Meanwhile, I learnt\r\nthat his mother Meena Nayyar has written a\r\nmemoir titled Tiger of Drass\u2013 Capt. Anuj Nayyar\r\n\u2013 23 \u2013 Kargil Hero which I shall certainly go\r\nthrough. I am sharing with you an excerpt of her\r\ninterview with IANS.\r\n\u201cWriting about the smallest things about your\r\nchild who is not with you really used to shake\r\nme but gradually I came to terms with it by\r\ntelling myself that if I didn\u2019t write about him no\r\none in the world would or could, and no one\r\nwill know about Anuj\u2019s sacrifice,\u201d\r\nPublished on : 13 Apr, 2022, 1:59 pm\r\nI have shared your experience with many of\r\nmy friends. We all wish to visit the National War\r\nMemorial, Delhi. We have found out a mobile app\r\n\u2018National War Memorial and Museum\u2019. This app\r\nis very interactive and provides answers to our\r\nqueries in 21 languages. The murals on the walls\r\nare enchanting. A great learning experience\r\nindeed!\r\nNext week, I am going to share this idea with\r\nmy classmates and my teacher. I think it would be\r\ngreat to create a collage capturing the lives and\r\nstories of people that can inspire us each day.\r\nI know that we can email each other. I really\r\nlike to receive letters from you, not just because\r\nof the ideas that you share but also because the\r\nenvelope of your letters often comes with beautiful\r\nstamps, that make me happy. I don\u2019t know if I\r\never shared it before, but collecting stamps is one\r\nof my favourite hobbies. I\u2019ve been doing it for\r\nyears. But I learnt recently that the act of collecting\r\nstamps is called \u2018philately\u2019. This time I received a\r\nstamp that celebrates India\u2019s independence, a\r\ntheme related to your letter.\r\nOkay, that\u2019s all from me for now. But before I\r\nconclude, guess what we had for breakfast!\u2014\r\nfluffy idlies and we all remembered you. Give my\r\nregards to your parents.\r\nI am inspired by your letter!\r\nHope to hear from you soon about your new\r\nadventures and experiences.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nAnanda\r\n",

        "content": "I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk.\r\nThe man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak.\r\nI had wanted one, but they were far too expensive. This\r\none was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces,\r\none leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one\r\nside. It was going for very little money. I thought I could\r\nrestore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to\r\nhave it. I paid the man and brought it back to my\r\nworkroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it\r\non Christmas Eve.\r\nI removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the\r\ndrawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere \u2014 it\r\nlooked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had\r\nclearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was\r\nstuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the\r\nend I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of\r\nmy fist and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space\r\nunderneath, a secret drawer. There was something in\r\nthere. I reached in and took out a small black tin box.\r\nSello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper,\r\nand written on it in shaky\r\nhandwriting: \u201cJim\u2019s\r\nlast letter, received\r\nJanuary 25, 1915.\r\nTo be buried with\r\nme when the\r\ntime comes.\u201d I\r\nknew as I did\r\nit that it was\r\nwrong of me to\r\nopen the box,\r\nbut curiosity\r\ngot the better of\r\nmy scruples. It\r\nusually does.\r\nInside the box there was an envelope. The address\r\nread: \u201cMrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport,\r\nDorset.\u201d I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written\r\nin pencil and dated at the top \u2014 \u201cDecember 26, 1914\u201d.\r\nDearest Connie,\r\nI write to you in a much happier frame of mind because\r\nsomething wonderful has just happened that I must tell\r\nyou about at once. We were all standing to in our trenches\r\nyesterday morning, Christmas morning. It was crisp and\r\nquiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I\u2019ve ever seen, as\r\ncold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be.\r\nI should like to be able to tell you that we began it.\r\nBut the truth, I\u2019m ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it.\r\nFirst someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches\r\nopposite. Then they were calling out to us from across\r\nno man\u2019s land, \u201cHappy Christmas, Tommy! Happy\r\nChristmas!\u201d When we had got over the surprise, some of\r\nus shouted back, \u201cSame to you, Fritz! Same to you!\u201d I\r\nthought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly\r\none of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving\r\na white flag. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, lads!\u201d someone shouted. And\r\nno one did. Then there was another Fritz up on the\r\nparapet, and another. \u201cKeep your heads down,\u201d I told the\r\nmen, \u201cit\u2019s a trick.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t.\r\nOne of the Germans was waving a bottle above his\r\nhead. \u201cIt is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps.\r\nWe have sausage. We meet you? Yes?\u201d By this time there\r\nwere dozens of them walking towards us across no man\u2019s\r\nland and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris\r\nwas the first up. \u201cCome on, boys. What are we waiting\r\nfor?\u201d And then there was no stopping them. I was the\r\nofficer. I should have stopped them there and then, I\r\nsuppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to\r\nme I should. All along their line and ours I could see\r\nmen walking slowly towards one another, grey coats,\r\nkhaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of\r\nthem. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we\r\nwere making peace.\r\nYou cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as\r\nI looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached\r\nme, hand outstretched. \u201cHans Wolf,\u201d he said, gripping\r\nmy hand warmly and holding it. \u201cI am from Dusseldorf.\r\nI play the cello in the orchestra. Happy Christmas.\u201d\r\n\u201cCaptain Jim Macpherson,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd a Happy\r\nChristmas to you too. I\u2019m a school teacher from Dorset,\r\nin the west of England.\u201d\r\n\u201cAh, Dorset,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI know this place. I know it\r\nvery well.\u201d We shared my rum ration and his excellent\r\nsausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke\r\nalmost perfect English. But it turned out that he had\r\nnever set foot in Dorset, never even been to England.\r\nHe had learned all he knew of England from school,\r\nand from reading books in English. His favourite writer\r\nwas Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the\r\nMadding Crowd. So out there in no man\u2019s land we talked\r\nof Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and\r\nDorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months\r\nago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki\r\nand grey everywhere, all over no man\u2019s land, smoking,\r\nlaughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I\r\nshared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake,\r\nConnie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had\r\never tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and\r\nhe was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party\r\nlike it, Connie.\r\nThen someone, I don\u2019t know who, brought out a\r\nfootball. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make\r\ngoalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy\r\nagainst Fritz out in the middle of no man\u2019s land. Hans\r\nWolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands\r\nand stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as\r\nanything. There was a moment when I noticed our\r\nbreaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too\r\nand smiled. \u201cJim Macpherson,\u201d he said after a while,\r\n\u201cI think this is how we should resolve this war. A football\r\nmatch. No one dies in a football match. No children are\r\norphaned. No wives become widows.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer cricket,\u201d I told him. \u201cThen we Tommies\r\ncould be sure of winning, probably.\u201d We laughed at\r\nthat, and together we watched the game. Sad to say,\r\nConnie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf\r\ngenerously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it\r\nwasn\u2019t quite fair.\r\nThe time came, and all too soon, when the game was\r\nfinished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage\r\nhad long since run out, and we knew it was all over.\r\nI wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see\r\nhis family again soon, that the fighting would end and\r\nwe could all go home.\r\n\u201cI think that is what every soldier wants, on both\r\nsides,\u201d Hans Wolf said. \u201cTake care, Jim Macpherson.\r\nI shall never forget this moment, nor you.\u201d He saluted\r\nand walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt.\r\nHe turned to wave just once and then became one of\r\nthe hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards\r\ntheir trenches.\r\nThat night, back in our dugouts, we heard them\r\nsinging a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was\r\nStille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing\r\nchorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged\r\ncarols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had\r\nour time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as\r\nlong as I live.\r\nConnie, Fritz won, two goals to one.

We had had\r\nour time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as\r\nlong as I live.\r\nI folded the letter again and slipped it carefully back\r\ninto its envelope. I kept awake all night. By morning I\r\nknew what I had to do. I drove into Bridport, just a few\r\nmiles away. I asked a boy walking his dog where Copper\r\nBeeches was. House number 12 turned out to be nothing\r\nbut a burned-out shell, the roof gaping, the windows\r\nboarded-up. I knocked at the house next door and asked\r\nif anyone knew the whereabouts of a Mrs Macpherson.\r\nOh yes, said the old man in his slippers, he knew her\r\nwell. A lovely old lady, he told me, a bit muddle-headed,\r\nbut at her age she was entitled to be, wasn\u2019t she? A\r\nhundred and one years old. She had been in the house\r\nwhen it caught fire. No one really knew how the fire had\r\nstarted, but it could well have been candles. She used\r\ncandles rather than electricity, because she always\r\nthought electricity was too expensive. The fireman had\r\ngot her out just in time. She was in a nursing home\r\nnow, he told me, Burlington House, on the Dorchester\r\nroad, on the other side of town.\r\nI found Burlington House Nursing Home easily enough.\r\nThere were paper chains up in the hallway and a lighted\r\nChristmas tree stood in the corner with a lopsided angel\r\non top. I said I was a friend come to visit Mrs Macpherson\r\nto bring her a Christmas present. I could see through\r\ninto the dining room where everyone was wearing a paper\r\nhat and singing. The matron had a hat on too and\r\nseemed happy enough to see me. She even offered me a\r\nmince pie. She walked me along the corridor.\r\n\u201cMrs Macpherson is not in with the others,\u201d she told\r\nme. \u201cShe\u2019s rather confused today so we thought it best\r\nif she had a good rest. She has no family you know, no\r\none visits. So I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be only too pleased to see\r\nyou.\u201d She took me into a conservatory with wicker chairs\r\nand potted plants all around and left me.\r\nThe old lady was sitting in a wheelchair, her hands\r\nfolded in her lap. She had silver white hair pinned into a\r\nwispy bun. She was gazing out at\r\nthe garden. \u201cHello,\u201d I said. She\r\nturned and looked up at me\r\nvacantly. \u201cHappy Christmas,\r\nConnie,\u201d I went on. \u201cI found\r\nthis. I think it\u2019s yours.\u201d As I was\r\nspeaking her eyes never left my\r\nface. I opened the tin box and\r\ngave it to her. That was the\r\nmoment her eyes lit up with\r\nrecognition and her face\r\nbecame suffused with a sudden\r\nglow of happiness. I explained\r\nabout the desk, about how I\r\nhad found it, but I don't think\r\nshe was listening. For a while\r\nshe said nothing, but stroked the letter tenderly with her\r\nfingertips.\r\nSuddenly she reached out and took my hand. Her\r\neyes were filled with tears. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d come home\r\nby Christmas, dearest,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here you are,\r\nthe best Christmas present in the world. Come closer,\r\nJim dear, sit down.\u201d\r\nI sat down beside her, and she kissed my cheek. \u201cI\r\nread your letter so often Jim, every day. I wanted to\r\nhear your voice in my head. It always made me feel you\r\nwere with me. And now you are. Now you\u2019re back you\r\ncan read it to me yourself. Would you do that for me,\r\nJim dear? I just want to hear your voice again. I\u2019d love\r\nthat so much. And then perhaps we\u2019ll have some tea.\r\nI\u2019ve made you a nice Christmas cake, marzipan all\r\naround. I know how much you love marzipan.\u201d",

        "content": "These stories are all from the Andaman and Nicobar\r\narchipelago.\r\nIgnesious was the manager of a cooperative society\r\nin Katchall. His wife woke him up at 6 a.m. because she\r\nfelt an earthquake. Ignesious carefully took his television\r\nset off its table and put it down on the ground so that it\r\nwould not fall and break. Then the family rushed out of\r\nthe house.\r\nWhen the tremors stopped, they saw the sea rising.\r\nIn the chaos and confusion, two of his children caught\r\nhold of the hands of their mother\u2019s father and mother\u2019s\r\nbrother, and rushed in the opposite direction. He never\r\nsaw them again. His wife was also swept away. Only the\r\nthree other children who came with him were saved.\r\n\r\nSanjeev was a policeman, serving in the Katchall island\r\nof the Nicobar group of islands. He somehow managed to\r\nsave himself, his wife and his baby daughter from the\r\nwaves. But then he heard cries for help from the wife of\r\nJohn, the guesthouse cook. Sanjeev jumped into the water\r\nto rescue her, but they were both swept away.\r\nThirteen year-old Meghna was swept away along with\r\nher parents and seventy-seven other people. She spent\r\ntwo days floating in the sea, holding on to a wooden door.\r\nEleven times she saw relief helicopters overhead, but they\r\ndid not see her. She was brought to the shore by a wave,\r\nand was found walking on the seashore in a daze.\r\n\r\nAlmas Javed was ten years old. She was a student of\r\nCarmel Convent in Port Blair where her father had a\r\npetrol pump. Her mother Rahila\u2019s home was in\r\nNancowry island. The family had gone there to celebrate\r\nChristmas.\r\nWhen the tremors came early in the morning, the\r\nfamily was sleeping. Almas\u2019s father saw the sea water\r\nrecede. He understood that the water would come\r\nrushing back with great force. He woke everyone up\r\nand tried to rush them to a safer place.\r\nAs they ran, her grandfather was hit on the head by\r\nsomething and he fell down. Her father rushed to help\r\nhim. Then came the first giant wave that swept both of\r\nthem away.\r\nAlmas\u2019s mother and\r\naunts stood clinging to the\r\nleaves of a coconut tree,\r\ncalling out to her. A wave\r\nuprooted the tree, and they\r\ntoo were washed away.\r\nAlmas saw a log of wood\r\nfloating. She climbed on to\r\nit. Then she fainted. When\r\nshe woke up, she was in a\r\nhospital in Kamorta. From there she was brought to\r\nPort Blair.\r\nThe little girl does not want to talk about the incident\r\nwith anyone. She is still traumatised.\r\n\r\nTilly Smith (a British school girl) was able to save many\r\nlives when the tsunami struck Phuket beach in Thailand.\r\nThough she has won a number of awards, her parents\r\nhave not allowed their daughter to be interviewed on\r\ntelevision and made into a heroine. Why do you think they\r\ntook that decision?\r\nNow here is a story from Thailand.\r\nThe Smith family from South-East England were\r\ncelebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern\r\nThailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her\r\nsister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny\r\nand Colin Smith.\r\nIt was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves\r\nwere already on their way. They had been triggered\r\nby a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier\r\nthat morning.\r\n\u201cThe water was swelling and kept coming in,\u201d Penny\r\nSmith remembered. \u201cThe beach was getting smaller and\r\nsmaller. I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d\r\nBut Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong.\r\nHer mind kept going back to a geography lesson she\r\nhad taken in England just two weeks before she flew\r\nout to Thailand with her family.\r\nTilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble\r\nand form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen\r\nthis in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the\r\nHawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had\r\nshown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis\r\ncan be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.\r\nTilly started to scream at her family to get off the\r\nbeach. \u201cShe talked about an earthquake under the sea.\r\nShe got more and more hysterical,\u201d said her mother\r\nPenny. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a tsunami was. But seeing\r\nmy daughter so frightened, I thought something serious\r\nmust be going on.\u201d\r\nTilly\u2019s parents took her and her sister away from the\r\nbeach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of\r\nother tourists also left the beach with them. \u201cThen it\r\nwas as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was\r\nscreaming, \u2018Run!\u2019\u201d\r\nThe family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel.\r\nThe building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves.\r\nIf they had stayed on the beach, they would not have\r\nbeen alive.\r\nThe Smiths later met other tourists who had lost\r\nentire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson,\r\nthey had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school\r\nin England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.\r\nBefore the giant waves slammed into the coast in\r\nIndia and Sri Lanka, wild and domestic animals seemed\r\nto know what was about to happen. They fled to safety.\r\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, elephants screamed\r\nand ran for higher ground; dogs refused to go outdoors;\r\nflamingoes abandoned their low-lying breeding areas;\r\nand zoo animals rushed into their shelters and could\r\nnot be enticed to come back out.\r\nMany people believe that animals possess a sixth\r\nsense and know when the earth is going to shake. Some\r\nexperts believe that animals\u2019 more acute hearing helps\r\nthem to hear or feel the earth\u2019s vibration. They can sense\r\nan approaching disaster long before humans realise\r\nwhat\u2019s going on.\r\nWe cannot be sure whether animals have a sixth\r\nsense or not. But the fact is that the giant waves that\r\nrolled through the Indian Ocean killed more than\r\n150,000 people in a dozen countries; but not many\r\nanimals have been reported dead.\r\nAlong India\u2019s Cuddalore coast, where thousands of\r\npeople perished, buffaloes, goats and dogs were found\r\nunharmed. The Yala National Park in Sri Lanka is home\r\nto a variety of animals including elephants, leopards,\r\nand 130 species of birds. Sixty visitors were washed\r\naway from the Patanangala beach inside the park; but\r\nno animal carcasses were found, except for two water\r\nbuffaloes. About an hour before the tsunami hit, people\r\nat Yala National Park had observed three elephants\r\nrunning away from the Patanangala beach.\r\nA Sri Lankan gentleman who lives on the coast near\r\nGalle said his two dogs would not go for their daily run\r\non the beach. \u201cThey are usually excited to go on this\r\nouting,\u201d he said. But on that day they refused to go,\r\nand most probably saved his life.;",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "Every Monday, on his way back from work, Bepin\r\nChoudhury would drop in at Kalicharan's in New Market\r\nto buy books. Crime stories, ghost stories and thrillers.\r\nHe had to buy at least five at a time to last him through\r\nthe week. He lived alone, was not a good mixer, had few\r\nfriends, and didn\u2019t like spending time in idle chat. Today,\r\nat Kalicharan\u2019s, Bepin Babu had the feeling that\r\nsomeone was observing him from close quarters. He\r\nturned round and found himself looking at a round\r\nfaced, meek looking man who now broke into a smile.\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you recognise me.\u201d\r\n\u201cHave we met before?\u201d asked Bepin Babu.\r\nThe man looked greatly surprised. \u201cWe met every day for a\r\nwhole week. I arranged for a car to take you to the Hudroo falls.\r\nIn 1958. In Ranchi. My name is Parimal Ghose.\u201d\r\n\u201cRanchi?\u201d\r\nNow Bepin Babu realised that it was not he but this\r\nman who was making a mistake. Bepin Babu had never\r\nbeen to Ranchi. He had been at the point of going several\r\ntimes, but never made it. He smiled and said, \u201cDo you\r\nknow who I am?\u201d\r\nThe man raised his eyebrows, bit his tongue and\r\nsaid, \u201cDo I know you? Who doesn\u2019t know Bepin\r\nChoudhury?\u201d\r\nBepin Babu now turned towards the bookshelves and\r\nsaid, \u201cStill you\u2019re making a mistake. One often does.\r\nI\u2019ve never been to Ranchi.\u201d\r\nThe man now laughed aloud.\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying, Mr Choudhury? You had a\r\nfall in Hudroo and cut your right knee. I brought you\r\niodine. I hadfixed up a car for you to go to Netarhat the\r\nnext day, but you couldn\u2019t because of the pain in the\r\nknee. Can\u2019t you recall anything? Someone else you know\r\nwas also in Ranchi at that time. Mr Dinesh Mukerji.\r\nYou stayed in a bungalow. You said you didn\u2019t like hotel\r\nfood and would prefer to have your meals cooked by a\r\nbawarchi. Mr Mukerji stayed with his sister. You had a\r\nbig argument about the moon landing, remember? I\u2019ll\r\ntell you more: you always carried a bag with your books\r\nin it on your sight-seeing trips. Am I right or not?\u201d\r\nBepin Babu spoke quietly, his eyes still on the books.\r\n\u201cWhich month in \u201958 are you talking about?\u201d\r\nThe man said, \u201cOctober.\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Bepin Babu. \u201cI spent Puja in \u201958 with\r\na friend in Kanpur. You\u2019re making a mistake. Good day.\u201d\r\nBut the man didn\u2019t go, nor did he stop talking.\r\n\u201cVery strange. One evening I had tea with you in a\r\nveranda of your bungalow. You spoke about your family.\r\nYou said you had no children, and that you had lost\r\nyour wife ten years ago. Your only brother had died\r\ninsane, which is why you didn\u2019t want to visit the mental\r\nhospital in Ranchi...\u201d\r\nWhen Bepin Babu had paid for the books and was\r\nleaving the shop, the man was still looking at him in\r\nutter disbelief.\r\nBepin Babu\u2019s car was safely parked in Bertram Street\r\nby the Lighthouse Cinema. He told the driver as he got\r\ninto the car, \u201cJust drive by the Ganga, will you, Sitaram.\u201d\r\nDriving up the Strand Road, Bepin Babu regretted\r\nhaving paid so much attention to the intruder. He had\r\nnever been to Ranchi \u2014 no question about it. It was\r\ninconceivable that he should forget such an incident\r\nwhich took place only six or seven years ago. He had an\r\nexcellent memory. Unless \u2014 Bepin Babu\u2019s head reeled.\r\nWas he losing his mind? But how could that be? He\r\nwas working daily in his office. It was a big firm, and he\r\nwas doing a responsible job. He wasn\u2019t aware of anything\r\never going seriously wrong. Only today he spoke for\r\nhalf an hour at an important meeting. And yet...\r\nAnd yet the man knew a great deal about him. How?\r\nHe even seemed to know some intimate details. The bag\r\nof books, wife\u2019s death, brother\u2019s insanity... The only\r\nmistake was about his having gone to Ranchi. Not a\r\nmistake; a deliberate lie. In \u201958, during the Pujas, he\r\nwas in Kanpur at his friend Haridas Bagchi\u2019s place.\r\nAll Bepin Babu had to do was write to \u2014 no, there was\r\nno way of writing to Haridas. Bepin Babu suddenly\r\nremembered that Haridas had left with his wife for Japan\r\nsome weeks ago, and he didn\u2019t have his address.\r\nBut where was the need for proof? He himself was\r\nfully aware that he hadn\u2019t been to Ranchi \u2014 and that\r\nwas that.\r\nThe river breeze was bracing, and yet a slight\r\ndiscomfort lingered in Bepin Babu\u2019s mind.\r\nAround Hastings, Bepin Babu decided to roll up his\r\ntrousers and take a look at his right knee.\r\nThere was the mark of an old inch-long cut. It was\r\nimpossible to tell when the injury had occurred.\r\n\r\nHad he never had a fall as a boy and cut his knee? He\r\ntried to recall such an incident, but couldn\u2019t.\r\nThen Bepin Babu suddenly thought of Dinesh\r\nMukerji. The man had said that Dinesh was in Ranchi\r\nat the same time. The best thing surely would be to ask\r\nhim. He lived quite near \u2014 in Beninandan Street. What\r\nabout going right now? But then, if he had really never\r\nbeen to Ranchi, what would Dinesh think if Bepin Babu\r\nasked for a confirmation? He would probably conclude\r\nBepin Babu was going nuts. No; it would be ridiculous\r\nto ask him.\r\nAnd he knew how ruthless Dinesh\u2019s sarcasm\r\ncould be.\r\nSipping a cold drink in his air-conditioned living\r\nroom, Bepin Babu felt at ease again. Such a nuisance!\r\nJust because they have nothing else to do, they go about\r\ngetting into other people\u2019s hair.\r\nAfter dinner, snuggling in bed with one of the new\r\nthrillers, Bepin Babu forgot all about the man in New\r\nMarket.\r\nNext day, in the office, Bepin Babu noticed that with\r\nevery passing hour, the previous day\u2019s encounter was\r\noccupying more and more of his mind. If the man knew\r\nso much about Bepin Babu, how could he make such a\r\nmistake about the Ranchi trip?\r\nJust before lunch Bepin Babu decided to ring up\r\nDinesh Mukerji. It was better to settle the question over\r\nthe phone; at least the embarrassment on his face\r\nwouldn\u2019t show.\r\nTwo-Three-Five-Six-One-Six. Bepin Babu dialled\r\nthe number.\r\n\u201cHallo.\u201d\r\n\u201cIs that Dinesh? This is Bepin here.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, well \u2014 what\u2019s the news?\u201d\r\n\u201cI just wanted to find out if you recalled an incident\r\nwhich took place in\u2019 58.\u201d\r\n\u201c\u201958? What incident?\u201d\r\n\u201cWere you in Calcutta right through that year? That\u2019s\r\nthe first thing I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d\r\n\u201cWait just a minute... \u201958... just let me check in\r\nmy diary.\u201d\r\nFor a minute there was silence. Bepin Babu could\r\nfeel that his heartbeat had gone up. He was sweating\r\na little.\r\n\u201cHallo.\u201d\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\u201cI've got it. I\u2019d been out twice.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\u201cOnce in February \u2014 nearby \u2014 to Krishnanagar to a\r\nnephew\u2019s wedding. And then... but you\u2019d know about\r\nthis one. The trip to Ranchi. You were there too. That\u2019s\r\nall. But what\u2019s all this sleuthing about?\u201d\r\n\u201cNo. I just wanted to \u2014 anyway, thanks.\u201d\r\nBepin Babu slammed the receiver down and gripped\r\nhis head with his hands. He felt his head swimming. A\r\nchill seemed to spread over his body. There were\r\nsandwiches in his tiffin box, but he didn\u2019t eat them. He\r\nhad lost his appetite.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch-time, Bepin Babu realised that he couldn\u2019t\r\npossibly carry on sitting at his desk and working. This\r\nhad never happened in the twenty-five years he had\r\nbeen with the firm. He had a reputation for being a\r\ntireless, conscientious worker. But today his head was\r\nin a whirl.\r\nBack home at two-thirty, Bepin Babu lay down in\r\nbed and tried to gather his wits together. He knew that\r\nit was possible to lose one\u2019s memory through an injury\r\nin the head, but he didn\u2019t know of a single instance of\r\nsomeone remembering everything except one particular\r\nincident \u2014 and a fairly recent and significant one at\r\nthat. He had always wanted to go to Ranchi; to have\r\ngone there, done things, and not to remember was\r\nsomething utterly impossible.\r\nAt seven thirty, Bepin Babu\u2019s servant came and\r\nannounced, \u201cChuni Babu, sir. Says it\u2019s very important.\u201d\r\nBepin Babu knew what Chuni had come for. Chunilal\r\nhad been at school with him. He\u2019d been having a rough\r\ntime lately and had been coming to see him about a\r\njob. Bepin Babu knew it was not possible to do anything\r\nfor him and, in fact, told him so. But Chuni kept turning\r\nup like a bad penny.\r\nBepin Babu sent word that not only was it not\r\npossible for him to see Chuni now, but not in several\r\nweeks.\r\nBut as soon as the servant stepped out of the room,\r\nit struck Bepin Babu that Chuni might remember\r\nsomething about the \u201958 trip. There was no harm in\r\nasking him.\r\nBepin Babu hurried down the stairs and into the\r\nliving room. Chuni was about to leave, but seeing Bepin\r\nBabu appear, he turned round hopefully.\r\nBepin Babu didn\u2019t beat about the bush.\r\n\u201cListen, Chuni - I want to ask you something. You\r\nhave a good memory, and you've been seeing me off\r\nand on for a long time. Just throw your mind back and\r\ntell me - did I go to Ranchi in \u201958?\u201d\r\nChuni said, \u201c\u201958? It must have been \u201958. Or was it\r\n\u201959?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure that I did go to Ranchi?\u201d\r\nChuni\u2019s look of amazement was not unmixed with\r\nworry.\r\n\u201cD\u2019 you mean you have doubts about having gone at\r\nall?\u201d\r\n\u201cDid I go? Do you remember clearly?\u201d\r\nChuni sat down on the sofa, fixed Bepin Babu with\r\na long, hard stare and said, \u201cBepin, have you taken to\r\ndrugs or something? As far as I know, you had a clean\r\nrecord where such things were concerned. I know that\r\nold friendships don\u2019t mean much to you, but at least\r\nyou had a good memory. You can\u2019t really mean that\r\nyou\u2019ve forgotten about the Ranchi trip?\u201d\r\nBepin Babu had to turn away from Chuni\u2019s\r\nincredulous stare.\r\n\u201cDo you remember what my last job was?\u201d asked\r\nChunilal.\r\n\u201cOf course. You worked in a travel agency.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou remember that and you don\u2019t remember that it\r\nwas I who fixed up your railway booking for Ranchi? I\r\nwent to the station to see you off; one of the fans in\r\nyour compartment was not working \u2014 I got an electrician\r\nto fix it. Have you forgotten everything? Whatever is the\r\nmatter with you? You don\u2019t look too well, you know.\u201d\r\nBepin Babu sighed and shook his head.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working too hard,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThat\r\nmust be the reason. Must see about consulting a\r\nspecialist.\u201d\r\nDoubtless it was Bepin\u2019s condition which made\r\nChunilal leave without mentioning anything about a job.\r\nParesh Chanda was a young physician with a pair of\r\nbright eyes and a sharp nose. He became thoughtful\r\nwhen he heard about Bepin Babu\u2019s symptoms. \u201cLook,\r\nDr Chanda,\u201d said Bepin Babu desperately, \u201cYou must\r\ncure me of this horrible illness. I can\u2019t tell you how it's\r\naffecting my work.\u201d\r\nDr Chanda shook his head.\r\n\u201cYou know what, Mr Choudhury,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never\r\nhad to deal with a case such as yours. Frankly, this is\r\nquite outside my field of experience. But I have one\r\nsuggestion. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work, but it\u2019s worth a\r\ntry. It can do no harm.\u201d\r\nBepin Babu leaned forward anxiously.\r\n\u201cAs far as I can make out,\u201d said Dr Chanda, \u201cAnd I\r\nthink you\u2019re of the same opinion \u2014 you must have been\r\nto Ranchi, but due to some unknown reason, the entire\r\nepisode has slipped out of your mind. What I suggest is\r\nthat you go to Ranchi once again. The sight of the place\r\nmay remind you of your trip. This is not impossible.\r\nMore than that I cannot do at the moment. I\u2019m\r\nprescribing a nerve tonic and a tranquilliser. Sleep is\r\nessential, or the symptoms will get more pronounced.\u201d\r\nBepin Babu felt somewhat better the next morning.\r\nAfter breakfast, he rang up his office, gave some\r\ninstructions and then procured a first class ticket for\r\nRanchi for the same evening.\r\nGetting off the train at Ranchi next morning, he realised\r\nat once that he had never been there before.\r\nHe came out of the station, took a taxi and drove\r\naround the town for a while. He realised that the streets,\r\nthe buildings, the hotels, the bazaars, the Morabadi Hill\r\n\u2014 with none of these had he the slightest acquaintance.\r\nWould a trip to the Hudroo Falls help? He didn't believe\r\nso, but, at the same time, he didn't wish to leave with the\r\nfeeling that he hadn\u2019t tried enough. So he arranged for a\r\ncar and left for Hudroo in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt five o\u2019clock the same afternoon in Hudroo, two\r\nGujarati gentlemen from a group of picnickers discovered\r\nBepin Babu lying unconscious beside a boulder. When\r\nhe came round, the first thing Bepin Babu said was,\r\n\u201cI\u2019m finished. There\u2019s no hope left.\u201d\r\nNext morning, Bepin Babu was back in Calcutta. He\r\nrealised that there was truly no hope for him. Soon he\r\nwould lose everything: his will to work, his confidence,\r\nhis ability, his balance of mind. Was he going to end up\r\nin the asylum at...? Bepin Babu couldn\u2019t think any more.\r\nBack home, he rang up Dr Chanda and asked him to\r\ncome over. Then, after a shower, he got into bed with an\r\nice bag clamped on his head. Just then the servant brought\r\nhim a letter which someone had left in the letter box.\r\nA greenish envelope with his name in red ink on it.\r\nAbove the name it said \u2018Urgent and Confidential\u2019. In\r\nspite of his condition, Bepin Babu had a feeling that he\r\nought to go through the letter. He tore open the envelope\r\nand took out the letter. This is what he read \u2014\r\n'Dear Bepin,\r\nI had no idea that affluence would bring about the kind of change in\r\nyou that it has done. Was it so difficult for you to help out an old friend\r\ndown on his luck? I have no money, so my resources are limited.\r\nWhat I have is imagination, a part of which I used in retribution of your\r\nunfeeling behaviour.\r\nWell, you\u2019ll be all right again now. A novel I\u2019ve written is being\r\nconsidered by a publisher. If he likes it enough, it'll see me through the\r\nnext few months.'\r\n\r\nWhen Dr Chanda came, Bepin Babu said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\r\nIt all came back as soon as I got off the train at Ranchi.\u201d\r\n\u201cA unique case,\u201d said Dr Chanda. \u201cI shall certainly\r\nwrite about it in a medical journal.\u201d\r\n\u201cThe reason why I sent for you,\u201d said Bepin Babu, \u201cis\r\nthat I have a pain in the hip from a fall I had in Ranchi.\r\nIf you could prescribe a pain killer\u2026\u201d;",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "Of all the emotions which surged through me as I stood\r\non the summit of Everest, looking over miles of\r\npanorama below us, the dominant one I think was\r\nhumility. The physical in me seemed to say, \u2018Thank\r\nGod, it\u2019s all over!\u201d However, instead of being jubilant,\r\nthere was a tinge of sadness. Was it because I had already\r\ndone the \u2018ultimate\u2019 in climbing and there would be\r\nnothing higher to climb and all roads hereafter would\r\nlead down?\r\nBy climbing the summit of Everest you are\r\noverwhelmed by a deep sense of joy and thankfulness.\r\nIt is a joy which lasts a lifetime. The experience changes\r\nyou completely. The man who has been to the mountains\r\nis never the same again.\r\nAs I look back at life after climbing Everest I cannot\r\nhelp remarking about the other summit \u2014 the summit\r\nof the mind \u2014 no less formidable and no easier to climb.\r\nEven when getting down from the summit, once the\r\nphysical exhaustion had gone, I began asking myself\r\nthe question why I had climbed Everest. Why did the\r\nact of reaching the summit have such a hold on my\r\nimagination? It was already a thing of the past,\r\nsomething done yesterday. With every passing day, it\r\nwould become more remote. And then what would\r\nremain? Would my memories fade slowly away?\r\nAll these thoughts led me to question myself as\r\nto why people climb mountains. It is not easy to\r\nanswer the question. The simplest answer would be,\r\nas others have said, \u201cBecause it is there.\u201d It presents\r\ngreat difficulties. Man takes delight in overcoming\r\nobstacles. The obstacles in climbing a mountain are\r\nphysical. A climb to a summit means endurance,\r\npersistence and will power. The demonstration of\r\nthese physical qualities is no doubt exhilarating, as\r\nit was for me also.\r\nI have a more personal answer to the question. From\r\nmy childhood I have been attracted by mountains. I\r\nhad been miserable, lost, when away from mountains,\r\nin the plains. Mountains are nature at its best. Their\r\nbeauty and majesty pose a great challenge, and like\r\nmany, I believe that mountains are a means of\r\ncommunion with God.\r\nOnce having granted this, the question remains: Why\r\nEverest? Because it is the highest, the mightiest and\r\nhas defied many previous attempts. It takes the last\r\nounce of one\u2019s energy. It is a brutal struggle with rock\r\nand ice. Once taken up, it cannot be given up halfway\r\neven when one\u2019s life is at stake. The passage back is as\r\ndifficult as the passage onwards. And then, when the\r\nsummit is climbed, there is the exhilaration, the joy of\r\nhaving done something, the sense of a battle fought\r\nand won. There is a feeling of victory and of happiness.\r\nGlimpsing a peak in the distance, I get transported\r\nto another world. I experience a change within myself\r\nwhich can only be called mystical. By its beauty,\r\naloofness, might, ruggedness, and the difficulties\r\nencountered on the way, the peak draws me to it \u2014 as\r\nEverest did. It is a challenge that is difficult to resist.\r\nLooking back I find that I have not\r\nyet fully explained why I climbed\r\nEverest. It is like answering a question\r\nwhy you breathe. Why do you help your\r\nneighbour? Why do you want to do good\r\nacts? There is no final answer possible.\r\nAnd then there is the fact that Everest\r\nis not just a physical climb. The man who\r\nhas been to the mountain-top becomes\r\nconscious in a special manner of his own\r\nsmallness in this large universe.\r\nThe physical conquest of a mountain\r\nis only one part of the achievement.\r\nThere is more to it than that. It is\r\nfollowed by a sense of fulfilment. There\r\nis the satisfaction of a deep urge to rise\r\nabove one\u2019s surroundings. It is the\r\neternal love for adventure in man. The experience is not\r\nmerely physical. It is emotional. It is spiritual.\r\nConsider a typical climb, towards the summit on the\r\nlast heights. You are sharing a rope with another\r\nclimber. You firm in. He cuts the steps in the hard ice.\r\nThen he belays and you inch your way up. The climb is\r\ngrim. You strain every nerve as you take every step.\r\nFamous climbers have left records of the help given by\r\nothers. They have also recorded how they needed just\r\nthat help. Else they might have given up. Breathing is\r\ndifficult. You curse yourself for having let yourself in for\r\nthis. You wonder why you ever undertook the ascent.\r\nThere are moments when you feel like going back. It\r\nwould be sheer relief to go down, instead of up. But\r\nalmost at once you snap out of that mood. There is\r\nsomething in you that does not let you give up the\r\nstruggle. And you go on. Your companion keeps up with\r\nyou. Just another fifty feet. Or a hundred, maybe. You\r\nask yourself: Is there no end? You look at your\r\ncompanion and he looks at you. You draw inspiration\r\nfrom each other. And then, without first being aware of\r\nit, you are at the summit.\r\nLooking round from the summit you tell yourself\r\nthat it was worthwhile. Other silvery peaks appear\r\nthrough the clouds. If you are lucky the sun may be on\r\nthem. The surrounding peaks look like a jewelled\r\nnecklace around the neck of your summit. Below, you\r\nsee vast valleys sloping into the distance. It is an\r\nennobling, enriching experience to just look down from\r\nthe summit of a mountain. You bow down and make\r\nyour obeisance to whichever God you worship.\r\nI left on Everest a picture of Guru Nanak. Rawat left\r\na picture of Goddess Durga. Phu Dorji left a relic of the\r\nBuddha. Edmund Hillary had buried a cross under a\r\ncairn (a heap of rocks and stones) in the snow. These\r\nare not symbols of conquest but of reverence.\r\nThe experience of having\r\nclimbed to the summit\r\nchanges you completely.\r\nThere is another summit.\r\nIt is within yourself. It is in\r\nyour own mind. Each man\r\ncarries within himself his\r\nown mountain peak. He\r\nmust climb it to reach to a\r\nfuller knowledge of himself.\r\nIt is fearful, and unscalable.\r\nIt cannot be climbed by\r\nanyone else. You yourself\r\nhave to do it. The physical\r\nact of climbing to the\r\nsummit of a mountain\r\noutside is akin to the act of climbing the mountain\r\nwithin. The effects of both the climbs are the same.\r\nWhether the mountain you climb is physical or\r\nemotional and spiritual, the climb will certainly change\r\nyou. It teaches you much about the world and about\r\nyourself.\r\nI venture to think that my experience as an Everester\r\nhas provided me with the inspiration to face life\u2019s ordeals\r\nresolutely. Climbing the mountain was a worthwhile\r\nexperience. The conquest of the internal summit is\r\nequally worthwhile. The internal summits are, perhaps,\r\nhigher than Everest.",

We\u2019ve got\r\nto get riding.\u201d\r\nMa Baxter asked\r\nanxiously, \u201cYou\u2019ll not be\r\ngone long?\u201d\r\nJody said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back\r\nbefore dinner for sure. \u201d\r\nMill-wheel mounted\r\nhis horse and pulled\r\nJody up behind him.\r\nHe said to Mill-wheel,\r\n\u201cDo you think the fawn\u2019s\r\nstill there? Will you help\r\nme find him?\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find him if he\u2019s alive. How you know it\u2019s a he?\u201d\r\n\u201cThe spots were all in a line. On a doe-fawn, Pa says\r\nthe spots are every which way\u2026\u201d\r\nJody gave himself over to thoughts of the fawn. They\r\npassed the abandoned clearing.\r\nHe said, \u201cCut to the north, Mill-wheel. It was up here\r\nthat Pa got bitten by the snake and killed the doe and I\r\nsaw the fawn.\u201d\r\nSuddenly Jody was unwilling to have Mill-wheel with\r\nhim. If the fawn was dead, or could not be found, he\r\ncould not have his disappointment seen. And if the fawn\r\nwas there, the meeting would be so lovely and so secret\r\nthat he could not endure to share it.\r\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s not far now, but the scrub is very thick\r\nfor a horse. I can make it on foot.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid to leave you, boy. Suppose you got\r\nlost or got bitten by the snake, too?\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care. It might take me a long time to find\r\nthe fawn, if he\u2019s wandered. Leave me off right here.\u201d\r\n\u201cAll right, but you take it easy now. You know north\r\nhere, and east?\u201d\r\n\u201cThere, and there. That tall pine makes a bearing.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo long.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo long, Mill-wheel. I\u2019m obliged.\u201d\r\nHe waited for the sound of the hooves to end, then\r\ncut to the right. The scrub was still. Only his own\r\ncrackling of twigs sounded across the silence. He\r\nwondered for an instant if he had mistaken his direction.\r\nThen a buzzard rose in front of him and flapped into\r\nthe air. He came into the clearing under the oaks.\r\nBuzzards sat in a circle around the carcass of the doe.\r\nThey turned their heads on their long scrawny necks\r\nand hissed at him. He threw his bough at them and\r\nthey flew into an adjacent tree. The sand showed large\r\ncat prints but the big cats killed fresh, and they had left\r\nthe doe to the carrion birds.\r\nHe parted the grass at the place where he had seen\r\nthe fawn. It did not seem possible that it was only\r\nyesterday. The fawn was not there. He circled the\r\nclearing. There was no sound, no sign. The buzzards\r\nclacked their wings, impatient to return to their\r\nbusiness. He returned to the spot where the fawn had\r\nemerged and dropped on all fours, studying the sand\r\nfor the small hoof prints. The night\u2019s rain had washed\r\naway all tracks except those of cat and buzzards.\r\nMovement directly in front of him startled him so that\r\nhe tumbled backward. The fawn lifted its face to his. It\r\nturned its head with a wide, wondering motion and\r\nshook him through with the stare of its liquid eyes. It\r\nwas quivering. It made no effort to rise or run. Jody\r\ncould not trust himself to move.\r\nHe whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\r\nThe fawn lifted its nose, scenting him. He reached\r\nout one hand and laid it on the soft neck. The touch\r\nmade him delirious. He moved forward on all fours until\r\nhe was close beside it. He put his arms around its body.\r\nA light convulsion passed over it but it did not stir.\r\nHe stroked its\r\nsides as gently\r\nas though the\r\nfawn were a\r\nchina deer and\r\nhe might break\r\nit. Its skin was\r\nvery soft. It was\r\nsleek and clean\r\nand had a\r\nsweet scent of\r\ngrass. He rose\r\nslowly and\r\nlifted the fawn\r\nfrom the ground. Its legs hung limply. They were\r\nsurprisingly long and he had to hoist the fawn as high\r\nas possible under his arm.\r\nHe was afraid that it might kick and bleat at sight\r\nand smell of its mother. He skirted the clearing and\r\npushed his way into the thicket. It was difficult to fight\r\nthrough with his burden. The fawn\u2019s legs caught in the\r\nbushes and he could not lift his own with freedom. He\r\ntried to shield its face from prickling vines. Its head\r\nbobbed with his stride. His heart thumped with the\r\nmarvel of its acceptance of him. He reached the trail\r\nand walked as fast as he could until he came to the\r\nintersection with the road home. He stopped to rest and\r\nset the fawn down on its dangling legs. It wavered on\r\nthem. It looked at him and bleated.\r\nHe said, enchanted, \u201cI\u2019ll carry you after I get my breath.\u201d\r\nHe remembered his father saying that a fawn would\r\nfollow if it had first been carried. He started away slowly.\r\nThe fawn stared after him. He came back to it and\r\nstroked it and walked away again. It took a few wobbling\r\nsteps toward him and cried piteously. It was willing to\r\nfollow him. It belonged to him. It was his own. He was\r\nlight-headed with his joy. He wanted to fondle it, to run\r\nand romp with it, to call to it to come to him. He dared\r\nnot alarm it. He picked it up and carried it in front of\r\nhim over his two arms. It seemed to him that he walked\r\nwithout effort.\r\nHis arms began to ache and he was forced to stop\r\nagain. When he walked on, the fawn followed him at\r\nonce. He allowed it to walk a little distance, then picked\r\nit up again. The distance home was nothing. He could\r\nhave walked all day and into the night, carrying it and\r\nwatching it follow. He was wet with sweat but a light\r\nbreeze blew through the June morning, cooling him.\r\nThe sky was as clear as spring water in a blue china\r\ncup. He came to the clearing. It was fresh and green\r\nafter the night\u2019s rain. He fumbled with the latch and\r\nwas finally obliged to set down the fawn to manage it.\r\nThen, he had an idea \u2014 he would walk into the house,\r\ninto Penny\u2019s bedroom, with the fawn walking behind\r\nhim. But at the steps, the fawn balked and refused to\r\nclimb them. He picked it up and went to his father.\r\nPenny lay with closed eyes.\r\nJody called, \u201cPa! Look!\u201d\r\nPenny turned his head. Jody stood beside him, the\r\nfawn clutched hard against him. It seemed to Penny\r\nthat the boy\u2019s eyes were as bright as the fawn\u2019s. He\r\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m glad you found him.\u201d\r\nJody then went to the kitchen. The fawn wobbled\r\nafter him. A pan of morning\u2019s milk stood in the kitchen\r\nsafe. The cream had risen on it. He skimmed the cream\r\ninto a jug. He poured milk into a small gourd. He held\r\nit out to the fawn. It butted it suddenly, smelling the\r\nmilk. He saved it precariously from spilling over the\r\nfloor. It could make nothing of the milk in the gourd.\r\nHe dipped his fingers in the milk and thrust them\r\ninto the fawn\u2019s soft wet mouth. It sucked greedily. When\r\nhe withdrew them, it bleated frantically and butted him.\r\nHe dipped his fingers again and as the fawn sucked, he\r\nlowered them slowly into the milk. The fawn blew and\r\nsucked and snorted. It stamped its small\r\nhoofs impatiently. As long as he held\r\nhis fingers below the level of the milk,\r\nthe fawn was content. It closed its\r\neyes dreamily. It was ecstasy to feel\r\nits tongue against his hand. Its\r\nsmall tail flicked back and forth.\r\nThe last of the milk vanished in\r\na swirl of foam and gurgling.",

        "content": "Cambridge was my metaphor for England, and it was\r\nstrange that when I left it had become altogether something\r\nelse, because I had met Stephen Hawking there.\r\nIt was on a walking tour through Cambridge that\r\nthe guide mentioned Stephen Hawking, \u2018poor man, who\r\nis quite disabled now, though he is a worthy successor\r\nto Issac Newton, whose Chair he has at the university.\u2019\r\nAnd I started, because I had quite forgotten that this\r\nmost brilliant and completely paralysed astrophysicist,\r\nthe author of A Brief History of Time, one of\r\nthe biggest best-sellers ever, lived here.\r\nWhen the walking tour was done, I rushed\r\nto a phone booth and, almost tearing the cord\r\nso it could reach me outside, phoned Stephen\r\nHawking\u2019s house. There was his assistant on\r\nthe line and I told him I had come in a\r\nwheelchair from India (perhaps he thought I\r\nhad propelled myself all the way) to write\r\nabout my travels in Britain. I had to see\r\nProfessor Hawking \u2014 even ten minutes would\r\ndo. \u201cHalf an hour,\u201c he said. \u201cFrom three-thirty\r\nto four.\u201d\r\nAnd suddenly I felt weak all over. Growing up\r\ndisabled, you get fed up with people asking you to be\r\nbrave, as if you have a courage account on which you\r\nare too lazy to draw a cheque. The only thing that\r\nmakes you stronger is seeing somebody like you,\r\nachieving something huge. Then you know how much\r\nis possible and you reach out further than you ever\r\nthought you could.\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been brave,\u201d said his disembodied\r\ncomputer-voice, the next afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve had no choice.\u201d\r\nSurely, I wanted to say, living creatively with the\r\nreality of his disintegrating body was a choice? But I\r\nkept quiet, because I felt guilty every time I spoke to\r\nhim, forcing him to respond. There he was, tapping at\r\nthe little switch in his hand, trying to find the words on\r\nhis computer with the only bit of movement left to him,\r\nhis long, pale fingers. Every so often, his eyes would\r\nshut in frustrated exhaustion. And sitting opposite him\r\nI could feel his anguish, the mind buoyant with thoughts\r\nthat came out in frozen phrases and sentences stiff as\r\ncorpses.\r\n\u201cA lot of people seem to think that disabled people\r\nare chronically unhappy,\u201d I said. \u201cI know that\u2019s not true\r\nmyself. Are you often laughing inside?\u201d\r\nAbout three minutes later, he responded, \u201cI find it\r\namusing when people patronise me.\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd do you find it annoying when someone like me\r\ncomes and disturbs you in your work?\u201d\r\nThe answer flashed. \u201cYes.\u201d Then he smiled his oneway\r\nsmile and I knew, without being sentimental or\r\nsilly, that I was looking at one of the most beautiful\r\nmen in the world.\r\nA first glimpse of him is shocking, because he is like a\r\nstill photograph \u2014 as if all those pictures of him in\r\nmagazines and newspapers have turned three-dimensional.\r\nThen you see the head twisted sideways into a slump,\r\nthe torso shrunk inside the pale blue shirt, the wasted\r\nlegs; you look at his eyes which can speak, still, and\r\nthey are saying something huge and urgent \u2014 it is hard\r\nto tell what. But you are shaken because you have seen\r\nsomething you never thought could be seen.\r\nBefore you, like a lantern whose walls are worn so\r\nthin you glimpse only the light inside, is the\r\nincandescence of a man. The body, almost irrelevant,\r\nexists only like a case made of shadows. So that I, no\r\nbeliever in eternal souls, know that this is what each of\r\nus is; everything else an accessory.\r\n\u201cWhat do you think is the best thing about being\r\ndisabled?\u201d I had asked him earlier.\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything good about being disabled.\u201d\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d I said, \u201cyou do discover how much kindness\r\nthere is in the world.\u201d\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said; it was a disadvantage of his voice\r\nsynthesiser that it could convey no inflection, no shades\r\nor tone. And I could not tell how enthusiastically he\r\nagreed with me.\r\nEvery time I shifted in my chair or turned my wrist\r\nto watch the time \u2014 I wanted to make every one of our\r\nthirty minutes count \u2014 I felt a huge relief and\r\nexhilaration in the possibilities of my body. How little it\r\nmattered then that I would never walk, or even stand.\r\nI told him how he had been an inspiration beyond\r\ncliche\u00b4 for me, and, surely, for others \u2014 did that thought\r\nhelp him?\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said; and I thought how foolish I was to ask.\r\nWhen your body is a claustrophobic room and the walls\r\nare growing narrower day by day, it doesn\u2019t do much\r\ngood to know that there are people outside smiling with\r\nadmiration to see you breathing still.\r\n\u201cIs there any advice you can give disabled people,\r\nsomething that might help make life better?\u201d\r\n\u201cThey should concentrate on what they are good at; I\r\nthink things like the disabled Olympics are a waste of time.\u201d\r\n\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d I remembered the years I\u2019d\r\nspent trying to play a Spanish guitar considerably larger\r\nthan I was; and how gleefully I had unstringed it one night.\r\nThe half-hour was up. \u201cI think I\u2019ve annoyed you\r\nenough,\u201d I said, grinning. \u201cThank you for...\u201d\r\n\u201cStay.\u201d I waited. \u201cHave some tea. I can show you the garden.\u201d\r\nThe garden was as big as a park, but Stephen\r\nHawking covered every inch, rumbling along in his\r\nmotorised wheelchair while I dodged to keep out of the\r\nway. We couldn\u2019t talk very much; the sun made\r\nhim silent, the letters on his screen\r\ndisappearing in the glare.\r\nAn hour later, we were ready to leave. I didn\u2019t\r\nknow what to do. I could not kiss him or cry. I\r\ntouched his shoulder and wheeled out into the\r\nsummer evening. I looked back; and I knew he\r\nwas waving, though he wasn\u2019t. Watching him,\r\nan embodiment of my bravest self, the one I\r\nwas moving towards, the one I had believed in\r\nfor so many years, alone, I knew that my\r\njourney was over. For now.",

        "content": "June 24\r\nThe first day of monsoon mist. And it\u2019s strange how all\r\nthe birds fall silent as the mist comes climbing up the\r\nhill. Perhaps that\u2019s what makes the mist so melancholy;\r\nnot only does it conceal the hills, it blankets them in\r\nsilence too. Only an hour ago the trees were ringing\r\nwith birdsong. And now the forest is deathly still as\r\nthough it were midnight.\r\nThrough the mist Bijju is calling to his sister. I can\r\nhear him running about on the hillside but I cannot\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 25\r\nSome genuine earlymonsoon\r\nrain, warm\r\nand humid, and not\r\nthat cold high-altitude\r\nstuff we\u2019ve been having\r\nall year. The plants\r\nseem to know it too,\r\nand the first cobra lily\r\nrears its head from the\r\nferns as I walk up to the\r\nbank and post office.\r\nThe mist affords a\r\ncertain privacy.\r\nA school boy asked\r\nme to describe the hill\r\nstation and valley in\r\none sentence, and all I could say was: \u201cA paradise that\r\nmight have been.\u201d\r\nJune 27\r\nThe rains have heralded the arrival of some seasonal\r\nvisitors\u2014a leopard, and several thousand leeches.\r\nYesterday afternoon the leopard lifted a dog from near\r\nthe servants\u2019 quarter below the school. In the evening it\r\nattacked one of Bijju\u2019s cows but fled at the approach of\r\nBijju\u2019s mother, who came screaming imprecations.\r\nAs for the leeches, I shall soon get used to a little\r\nbloodletting every day.\r\nOther new arrivals are the scarlet minivets (the\r\nfemales are yellow), flitting silently among the leaves\r\nlike brilliant jewels. No matter how leafy the trees, these\r\nbrightly coloured birds cannot conceal themselves,\r\nalthough, by remaining absolutely silent, they\r\nsometimes contrive to go unnoticed. Along come a pair\r\nof drongos, unnecessarily aggressive, chasing the\r\nminivets away.\r\nA tree creeper moves rapidly up the trunk of the\r\noak tree, snapping up insects all the way. Now that\r\nthe rains are here, there is no dearth of food for the\r\ninsectivorous birds.\r\n\r\nAugust 2\r\nAll night the rain has been drumming on the\r\ncorrugated tin roof. There has been no storm, no\r\nthunder, just the steady swish of a tropical downpour.\r\nIt helps me to lie awake; at the same time, it doesn\u2019t\r\nkeep me from sleeping.\r\nIt is a good sound to read by \u2014 the rain outside, the\r\nquiet within \u2014 and, although tin roofs are given to\r\nspringing unaccountable leaks, there is a feeling of being\r\nuntouched by, and yet in touch with, the rain\r\nAugust 3\r\nThe rain stops. The clouds begin to break up, the sun\r\nstrikes the hill on my left. A woman is chopping up\r\nsticks. I hear the tinkle of cowbells. In the oak tree, a\r\ncrow shakes the raindrops from his feathers and caws\r\ndisconsolately. Water drips from a leaking drainpipe.\r\nAnd suddenly, clean and pure, the song of the whistling\r\nthrush emerges like a dark sweet secret from the depths\r\nof the ravine.\r\nAugust 12\r\nEndless rain, and a permanent mist. We haven\u2019t seen\r\nthe sun for eight or nine days. Everything damp and\r\nsoggy. Nowhere to go. Pace the room, look out of the\r\nwindow at a few bobbing umbrellas. At least it isn\u2019t cold\r\nrain. The hillsides are lush\r\nas late-monsoon flowers\r\nbegin to appear \u2014 wild\r\nbalsam, dahlias, begonias\r\nand ground orchids.\r\nAugust 31\r\nIt is the last day of August,\r\nand the lush monsoon\r\ngrowth has reached its\r\npeak. The seeds of the\r\ncobra lily are turning red,\r\nsignifying that the rains are coming to an end.\r\nIn a few days the ferns will start turning yellow, but\r\nright now they are still firm, green and upright. Ground\r\norchids, mauve lady\u2019s slipper and the white butterfly\r\norchids put on a fashion display on the grassy slopes of\r\nLandour. Wild dahlias, red, yellow and magenta, rear\r\ntheir heads from the rocky crevices where they have\r\ntaken hold.\r\nSnakes and rodents, flooded out of their holes and\r\nburrows, take shelter in roofs, attics and godowns. A\r\nshrew, weak of eyesight, blunders about the rooms,\r\nmuch to the amusement of the children.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill it,\u201d admonishes their grandmother.\r\n\u201cChuchundars are lucky \u2014 they bring money!\u201d\r\nAnd sure enough, I receive a cheque in the mail. Not\r\na very large one, but welcome all the same.\r\nOctober 3\r\nWe have gone straight from monsoon into winter rain.\r\nSnow at higher altitudes.\r\nAfter an evening hailstorm, the sky and hills are\r\nsuffused with a beautiful golden light.\r\n\r\nJanuary 26\r\nWinter Rains in the Hills\r\nIn the hushed silence of the house\r\nwhen I am quite alone, and my friend,\r\nwho was here\r\nhas gone, it is very lonely, very quiet,\r\nas I sit in a liquid silence, a silence\r\nwithin,\r\nsurrounded by the rhythm of rain,\r\nthe steady drift\r\nof water on leaves, on lemons, on roof,\r\ndrumming on drenched dahlias and\r\nwindow panes,\r\nwhile the mist holds the house in a dark\r\ncaress.\r\nAs I pause near a window, the rain stops.\r\nAnd starts again.\r\nAnd the trees, no longer green but grey,\r\nmenace me with their loneliness.\r\nMarch 23\r\nLate March. End of winter.\r\nThe blackest cloud I\u2019ve ever seen squatted over\r\nMussoorie, and then it hailed marbles for half an hour.\r\nNothing like a hailstorm to clear the sky. Even as I write,\r\nI see a rainbow forming.",

Margie\u2019s grandfather once\r\nsaid that when he was a little boy his grandfather\r\ntold him that there was a time when all stories\r\nwere printed on paper.\r\nThey turned the pages, which were yellow and\r\ncrinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words\r\nthat stood still instead of moving the way they were\r\nsupposed to \u2014 on a screen, you know. And then\r\nwhen they turned back to the page before, it had\r\nthe same words on it that it had had when they\r\nread it the first time.\r\n2. \u201cGee,\u201d said Tommy, \u201cwhat a waste. When you\u2019re\r\nthrough with the book, you just throw it away, I\r\nguess. Our television screen must have had a million\r\nbooks on it and it\u2019s good for plenty more. I wouldn\u2019t\r\nthrow it away.\u201d\r\n\u201cSame with mine,\u201d said Margie. She was eleven\r\nand hadn\u2019t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had.\r\nHe was thirteen.\r\nShe said, \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d\r\n\u201cIn my house.\u201d He pointed without looking,\r\nbecause he was busy reading. \u201cIn the attic.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\r\n\u201cSchool.\u201d\r\n3. Margie was scornful. \u201cSchool? What\u2019s there to write\r\nabout school? I hate school.\u201d\r\nMargie always hated school, but now she hated\r\nit more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been\r\ngiving her test after test in geography and she had\r\nbeen doing worse and worse until her mother had\r\nshaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County\r\nInspector.\r\n4. He was a round little man with a red face and a\r\nwhole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled\r\nat Margie and gave her an apple, then took the\r\nteacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn\u2019t know\r\nhow to put it together again, but he knew how all\r\nright, and, after an hour or so, there it was again,\r\nlarge and black and ugly, with a big screen on which\r\nall the lessons were shown and the questions were\r\nasked. That wasn\u2019t so bad. The part Margie hated\r\nmost was the slot where she had to put homework\r\nand test papers. She always had to write them out\r\nin a punch code they made her learn when she was\r\nsix years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated\r\nthe marks in no time.\r\n5. The Inspector had smiled after he was finished and\r\npatted Margie\u2019s head. He said to her mother, \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nnot the little girl\u2019s fault, Mrs Jones. I think the\r\ngeography sector was geared a little too quick. Those\r\nthings happen sometimes. I\u2019ve slowed it up to an\r\naverage ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern\r\nof her progress is quite satisfactory.\u201d And he patted\r\nMargie\u2019s head again.\r\nMargie was disappointed. She had been hoping\r\nthey would take the teacher away altogether. They\r\nhad once taken Tommy\u2019s teacher away for nearly a\r\nmonth because the history sector had blanked out\r\ncompletely.\r\nSo she said to Tommy, \u201cWhy would anyone write\r\nabout school?\u201d\r\n6. Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes.\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not our kind of school, stupid. This is\r\nthe old kind of school that they had hundreds and\r\nhundreds of years ago.\u201d He added loftily,\r\npronouncing the word carefully, \u201cCenturies ago.\u201d\r\nMargie was hurt. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\r\nkind of school they had all that time ago.\u201d She read\r\nthe book over his shoulder for a while, then said,\r\n\u201cAnyway, they had a teacher.\u201d\r\n\u201cSure they had a teacher, but it wasn\u2019t a regular\r\nteacher. It was a man.\u201d\r\n\u201cA man? How could a man be a teacher?\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, he just told the boys and girls things and\r\ngave them homework and asked them questions.\u201d\r\n7. \u201cA man isn\u2019t smart enough.\u201d\r\n\u201cSure he is. My father knows as much as my\r\nteacher.\u201d\r\n\u201cHe knows almost as much, I betcha.\u201d\r\nMargie wasn\u2019t prepared to dispute that. She said,\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want a strange man in my house to\r\nteach me.\u201d\r\nTommy screamed with laughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t know\r\nmuch, Margie. The teachers didn\u2019t live in the\r\nhouse. They had a special building and all the\r\nkids went there.\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd all the kids learned the same thing?\u201d\r\n\u201cSure, if they were the same age.\u201d\r\n8. \u201cBut my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to\r\nfit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that\r\neach kid has to be taught differently.\u201d\r\n\u201cJust the same they didn\u2019t do it that way then.\r\nIf you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to read the book.\u201d\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Margie said quickly.\r\nShe wanted to read about those funny schools.\r\nThey weren\u2019t even half finished when Margie\u2019s\r\nmother called, \u201cMargie! School!\u201d\r\nMargie looked up. \u201cNot yet, Mamma.\u201d\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d said Mrs Jones. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably time\r\nfor Tommy, too.\u201d\r\nMargie said to Tommy, \u201cCan I read the book some\r\nmore with you after school?\u201d\r\n9. \u201cMay be,\u201d he said nonchalantly. He walked away\r\nwhistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath\r\nhis arm.\r\nMargie went into the schoolroom. It was right\r\nnext to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher\r\nwas on and waiting for her. It was always on at the\r\nsame time every day except Saturday and Sunday,\r\nbecause her mother said little girls learned better\r\nif they learned at regular hours.\r\nThe screen was lit up, and it said: \u201cToday\u2019s\r\narithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper\r\nfractions. Please insert yesterday\u2019s homework in the\r\nproper slot.\u201d\r\n10. Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about\r\nthe old schools they had when her grandfather\u2019s\r\ngrandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the\r\nwhole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting\r\nin the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom,\r\ngoing home together at the end of the day. They\r\nlearned the same things, so they could help one\r\nanother with the homework and talk about it.\r\nAnd the teachers were people\u2026\r\nThe mechanical teacher was flashing on the\r\nscreen: \u201cWhen we add fractions \u00bd and \u00bc...\u201d\r\nMargie was thinking about how the kids must\r\nhave loved it in the old days. She was thinking\r\nabout the fun they had.",

        "content": "RUSH hour crowds jostle for position on the\r\nunderground train platform. A slight girl, looking\r\nyounger than her seventeen years, was nervous yet\r\nexcited as she felt the vibrations of the approaching\r\ntrain. It was her first day at the prestigious Royal\r\nAcademy of Music in London and daunting enough\r\nfor any teenager fresh from a Scottish farm. But\r\nthis aspiring musician faced a bigger challenge than\r\nmost: she was profoundly deaf.\r\n2. Evelyn Glennie\u2019s loss of hearing had been gradual.\r\nHer mother remembers noticing something was\r\nwrong when the eight-year-old Evelyn was waiting\r\nto play the piano. \u201cThey called her name and she\r\ndidn\u2019t move. I suddenly realised she hadn\u2019t heard,\u201d\r\nsays Isabel Glennie. For quite a while Evelyn\r\nmanaged to conceal her growing deafness from\r\nfriends and teachers. But by the time she was\r\neleven her marks had deteriorated and her\r\nheadmistress urged her parents to take her to a\r\nspecialist. It was then discovered that her hearing\r\nwas severely impaired as a result of gradual nerve\r\ndamage. They were advised that she should be fitted\r\nwith hearing aids and sent to a school for the deaf.\r\n\u201cEverything suddenly looked black,\u201d says Evelyn.\r\n3. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was\r\ndetermined to lead a normal life and pursue her\r\ninterest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing\r\na xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it\r\ntoo. Most of the teachers discouraged her but\r\npercussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He\r\nbegan by tuning two large drums to different notes.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen through your ears,\u201d he would say, \u201ctry\r\nto sense it some other way.\u201d Says Evelyn, \u201cSuddenly\r\nI realised I could feel the higher drum from the\r\nwaist up and the lower one from the waist down.\u201d\r\nForbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn\r\ndiscovered that she could sense certain notes in\r\ndifferent parts of her body. \u201cI had learnt to open my\r\nmind and body to sounds and vibrations.\u201d The rest\r\nwas sheer determination and hard work.\r\n4. She never looked back from that point onwards.\r\nShe toured the United Kingdom with a youth\r\norchestra and by the time she was sixteen, she had\r\ndecided to make music her life. She auditioned for\r\nthe Royal Academy of Music and scored one of the\r\nhighest marks in the history of the academy. She\r\ngradually moved from orchestral work to solo\r\nperformances. At the end of her three-year course,\r\nshe had captured most of the top awards.\r\n5. And for all this, Evelyn won\u2019t accept any hint of\r\nheroic achievement. \u201cIf you work hard and know\r\nwhere you are going, you\u2019ll get there.\u201d And she got\r\nright to the top, the world\u2019s most sought-after multipercussionist\r\nwith a mastery of some thousand\r\ninstruments, and hectic international schedule.\r\n6. It is intriguing to watch Evelyn function so\r\neffortlessly without hearing. In our two-hour\r\ndiscussion she never missed a word. \u201cMen with\r\nbushy beards give me trouble,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt is\r\nnot just watching the lips, it\u2019s the whole face,\r\nespecially the eyes.\u201d She speaks flawlessly with a\r\nScottish lilt. \u201cMy speech is clear because I could\r\nhear till I was eleven,\u201d she says. But that doesn\u2019t\r\nexplain how she managed to learn French and\r\nmaster basic Japanese.\r\n7. As for music, she explains, \u201cIt pours in through\r\nevery part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my\r\ncheekbones and even in my hair.\u201d When she plays\r\nthe xylophone, she can sense the sound passing up\r\nthe stick into her fingertips. By leaning against the\r\ndrums, she can feel the resonances flowing into her\r\nbody. On a wooden platform she removes her shoes\r\nso that the vibrations pass through her bare feet\r\nand up her legs.\r\nnot just watching the lips, it\u2019s the whole face,\r\nespecially the eyes.\u201d She speaks flawlessly with a\r\nScottish lilt. \u201cMy speech is clear because I could\r\nhear till I was eleven,\u201d she says.

On a wooden platform she removes her shoes\r\nso that the vibrations pass through her bare feet\r\nand up her legs.\r\nNot surprisingly, Evelyn delights her audiences. In\r\n1991 she was presented with the Royal\r\nPhilharmonic Society\u2019s prestigious Soloist of the Year\r\nAward. Says master percussionist James Blades,\r\n\u201cGod may have taken her hearing but he has given\r\nher back something extraordinary. What we hear,\r\nshe feels \u2014 far more deeply than any of us. That is\r\nwhy she expresses music so beautifully.\u201d\r\n9. Evelyn confesses that she is something of a\r\nworkaholic. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to work . . . often harder\r\nthan classical musicians. But the rewards are\r\nenormous.\u201d Apart from the regular concerts, Evelyn\r\nalso gives free concerts in prisons and hospitals.\r\nShe also gives high priority to classes for young\r\nmusicians. Ann Richlin of the Beethoven Fund for\r\nDeaf Children says, \u201cShe is a shining inspiration\r\nfor deaf children. They see that there is nowhere\r\nthat they cannot go.\u201d\r\n10. Evelyn Glennie has already accomplished more than\r\nmost people twice her age. She has brought\r\npercussion to the front of the orchestra, and\r\ndemonstrated that it can be very moving. She has\r\ngiven inspiration to those who are handicapped,\r\npeople who look to her and say, \u2018If she can do it, I\r\ncan.\u2019 And, not the least, she has given enormous\r\npleasure to millions.",

        "content": "EMPEROR Aurangzeb banned the playing of a musical\r\ninstrument called pungi in the royal residence for\r\nit had a shrill unpleasant sound. Pungi became the\r\ngeneric name for reeded noisemakers. Few had\r\nthought that it would one day be revived. A barber\r\nof a family of professional musicians, who had access\r\nto the royal palace, decided to improve the tonal\r\nquality of the pungi. He chose a pipe with a natural\r\nhollow stem that was longer and broader than the\r\npungi, and made seven holes on the body of the\r\npipe. When he played on it, closing and opening\r\nsome of these holes, soft and melodious sounds were\r\n2. The sound of the shehnai began to be considered\r\nauspicious. And for this reason it is still played in\r\ntemples and is an indispensable component of any\r\nNorth Indian wedding. In the past, the shehnai was\r\npart of the naubat or traditional ensemble of nine\r\ninstruments found at royal courts. Till recently it\r\nwas used only in temples and weddings. The credit\r\nfor bringing this instrument onto the classical stage\r\ngoes to Ustad Bismillah Khan.\r\n3. As a five-year old, Bismillah Khan played gilli-danda\r\nnear a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon in\r\nBihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Bihariji\r\ntemple to sing the Bhojpuri \u2018Chaita\u2019, at the end of\r\nwhich he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25 kg,\r\na prize given by the local Maharaja. This happened\r\n80 years ago, and the little boy has travelled far to\r\nearn the highest civilian award in India \u2014 the\r\nBharat Ratna.\r\n4. Born on 21 March 1916, Bismillah belongs to a\r\nwell-known family of musicians from Bihar. His\r\ngrandfather, Rasool Bux Khan, was the shehnainawaz\r\nof the Bhojpur king\u2019s court. His father,\r\nPaigambar Bux, and other paternal ancestors were\r\nalso great shehnai players.\r\nThe young boy took to music early in life. At the age of\r\nthree when his mother took him to his maternal\r\nuncle\u2019s house in Benaras (now Varanasi), Bismillah\r\nwas fascinated watching his uncles practise the\r\nshehnai. Soon Bismillah started accompanying his\r\nuncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple of Benaras where\r\nBux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would\r\nplay the shehnai and Bismillah would sit captivated\r\nfor hours on end. Slowly, he started getting lessons\r\nin playing the instrument and would sit practising\r\nthroughout the day. For years to come the temple of\r\nBalaji and Mangala Maiya and the banks of the Ganga\r\nbecame the young apprentice\u2019s favourite haunts where\r\nhe could practise in solitude. The flowing waters of\r\nthe Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas\r\nthat were earlier considered to be beyond the range\r\nof the shehnai.\r\nAt the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his uncle\r\nto the Allahabad Music Conference. At the end of\r\nhis recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the young\r\nboy\u2019s back and said, \u201cWork hard and you shall make\r\nit.\u201d With the opening of the All India Radio in\r\nLucknow in 1938 came Bismillah\u2019s big break. He\r\nsoon became an often-heard shehnai player on radio.\r\n7. When India gained independence on 15 August 1947,\r\nBismillah Khan became the first Indian to greet the\r\nnation with his shehnai. He poured his heart out\r\ninto Raag Kafi from the Red Fort to an audience\r\nwhich included Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who later\r\ngave his famous \u2018Tryst with Destiny\u2019 speech.\r\n8. Bismillah Khan has given many memorable\r\nperformances both in India and abroad. His first\r\ntrip abroad was to Afghanistan where King Zahir\r\nShah was so taken in by the maestro that he gifted\r\nhim priceless Persian carpets and other souvenirs.\r\nThe King of Afghanistan was not the only one to be\r\nfascinated with Bismillah\u2019s music. Film director\r\nVijay Bhatt was so impressed after hearing\r\nBismillah play at a festival that he named a film\r\nafter the instrument called Gunj Uthi Shehnai. The\r\nfilm was a hit, and one of Bismillah Khan\u2019s\r\ncompositions, \u201cDil ka khilona hai toot gaya...,\u201d turned\r\nout to be a nationwide chartbuster! Despite this\r\nhuge success in the celluloid world, Bismillah\r\nKhan\u2019s ventures in film music were limited to two:\r\nVijay Bhatt\u2019s Gunj Uthi Shehnai and Vikram\r\nSrinivas\u2019s Kannada venture, Sanadhi Apanna. \u201cI just\r\ncan\u2019t come to terms with the artificiality and\r\nglamour of the film world,\u201d he says with emphasis.\r\n9. Awards and recognition came thick and fast.\r\nBismillah Khan became the first Indian to be invited\r\nto perform at the prestigious Lincoln Centre Hall in\r\nthe United States of America. He also took part in\r\nthe World Exposition in Montreal, in the Cannes\r\nArt Festival and in the Osaka Trade Fair. So well\r\nknown did he become internationally that an\r\nauditorium in Teheran was named after him \u2014\r\nTahar Mosiquee Ustaad Bismillah Khan.\r\n10. National awards like the Padmashri, the Padma\r\nBhushan and the Padma Vibhushan were\r\nconferred on him.\r\n11. In 2001, Ustad Bismillah Khan was awarded India\u2019s\r\nhighest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. With the\r\ncoveted award resting on his chest and his eyes\r\nglinting with rare happiness he said, \u201cAll I would\r\nlike to say is: Teach your children music, this is\r\nHindustan\u2019s richest tradition; even the West is now\r\ncoming to learn our music.\u2019\u2019\r\n12. In spite of having travelled all over the world \u2014\r\nKhansaab as he is fondly called \u2014 is exceedingly\r\nfond of Benaras and Dumraon and they remain for\r\nhim the most wonderful towns of the world. A\r\nstudent of his once wanted him to head a shehnai\r\nschool in the U.S.A., and the student promised to\r\nrecreate the atmosphere of Benaras by replicating\r\nthe temples there. But Khansaab asked him if he\r\nwould be able to transport River Ganga as well.\r\nLater he is remembered to have said, \u201cThat is why\r\nwhenever I am in a foreign country, I keep yearning\r\nto see Hindustan. While in Mumbai, I think of only\r\nBenaras and the holy Ganga. And while in Benaras,\r\nI miss the unique mattha of Dumraon.\u201d\r\nSHEKHAR GUPTA: When Partition happened, didn\u2019t you and your\r\nfamily think of moving to Pakistan?\r\nBISMILLAH KHAN: God forbid! Me, leave Benaras? Never! I went\r\nto Pakistan once\u2014I crossed the border just to say I have been\r\nto Pakistan. I was there for about an hour. I said namaskar\r\nto the Pakistanis and salaam alaikum to the Indians! I had a\r\ngood laugh.\r\nUstad Bismillah Khan\u2019s life is a perfect example of\r\nthe rich, cultural heritage of India, one that\r\neffortlessly accepts that a devout Muslim like him\r\ncan very naturally play the shehnai every morning\r\nat the Kashi Vishwanath temple.\r\n[Ustad Bismillah Khan passed away on 21 August 2006 at\r\nthe age of ninety after a prolonged illness. He was given a\r\nstate funeral and the Government of India declared one day\r\nof national mourning.];\r\n",

Mother, go and see if my paper\u2019s\r\nout there \u2014 and bring me my slippers.\u201d\r\n2. \u201cKezia,\u201d Mother would call to her, \u201cif you\u2019re a good\r\ngirl you can come down and take off father\u2019s boots.\u201d\r\nSlowly the girl would slip down the stairs, more\r\nslowly still across the hall, and push open the\r\ndrawing-room door.\r\nBy that time he had his spectacles on and looked\r\nat her over them in a way that was terrifying to\r\nthe little girl.\r\n\u201cWell, Kezia, hurry up and pull off these boots\r\nand take them outside. Have you been a good\r\ngirl today?\u201d\r\n\u201cI d-d-don\u2019t know, Father.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou d-d-don\u2019t know? If you stutter like that\r\nMother will have to take you to the doctor.\u201d\r\n3. She never stuttered with other people \u2014 had quite\r\ngiven it up \u2014 but only with Father, because then\r\nshe was trying so hard to say the words properly.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you looking so\r\nwretched about? Mother, I wish you taught this child\r\nnot to appear on the brink of suicide... Here, Kezia,\r\ncarry my teacup back to the table carefully.\u201d\r\nHe was so big \u2014 his hands and his neck,\r\nespecially his mouth when he yawned. Thinking\r\nabout him alone was like thinking about a giant.\r\n4. On Sunday afternoons Grandmother sent her down\r\nto the drawing-room to have a \u201cnice talk with Father\r\nand Mother\u201d. But the little girl always found Mother\r\nreading and Father stretched out on the sofa, his\r\nhandkerchief on his face, his feet on one of the best\r\ncushions, sleeping soundly and snoring.\r\nShe sat on a stool, gravely watched him until he\r\nwoke and stretched, and asked the time \u2014 then\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t stare so, Kezia. You look like a little\r\nbrown owl.\u201d\r\nOne day, when she was kept indoors with a cold,\r\nher grandmother told her that father\u2019s birthday was\r\nnext week, and suggested she should make him a\r\npin-cushion for a gift out of a beautiful piece of\r\nyellow silk.\r\n5. Laboriously, with a double cotton, the little girl\r\nstitched three sides. But what to fill it with? That\r\nwas the question. The grandmother was out in the\r\ngarden, and she wandered into Mother\u2019s bedroom\r\nto look for scraps. On the bed-table she discovered\r\na great many sheets of fine paper, gathered them\r\nup, tore them into tiny pieces, and stuffed her case,\r\nthen sewed up the fourth side.\r\nThat night there was a hue and cry in the house.\r\nFather\u2019s great speech for the Port Authority had\r\nbeen lost. Rooms were searched; servants\r\nquestioned. Finally Mother came into Kezia\u2019s room.\r\n\u201cKezia, I suppose you didn\u2019t see some papers on\r\na table in our room?\u201d\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said, \u201cI tore them up for my\r\nsurprise.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d screamed Mother. \u201cCome straight down\r\nto the dining-room this instant.\u201d\r\n6. And she was dragged down to where Father was\r\npacing to and fro, hands behind his back.\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he said sharply.\r\nMother explained.\r\nHe stopped and stared at the child.\r\n\u201cDid you do that?\u201d\r\n\u201cN-n-no\u201d, she whispered.\r\n\u201cMother, go up to her room and fetch down the\r\ndamned thing \u2014 see that the child\u2019s put to bed\r\nthis instant.\u201d\r\nCrying too much to explain, she lay in the shadowed\r\nroom watching the evening light make a sad little\r\npattern on the floor.\r\nThen Father came into the room with a ruler in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\u201cI am going to beat you for this,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cOh, no, no\u201d, she screamed, hiding under the\r\nbedclothes.\r\nHe pulled them aside.\r\n\u201cSit up,\u201d he ordered, \u201cand hold out your hands.\r\nYou must be taught once and for all not to touch\r\nwhat does not belong to you.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut it was for your b-b-birthday.\u201d\r\nDown came the ruler on her little, pink palms.\r\n8. Hours later, when Grandmother had wrapped her\r\nin a shawl and rocked her in the rocking-chair, the\r\nchild clung to her soft body.\r\n\u201cWhat did God make fathers for?\u201d she sobbed.\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a clean hanky, darling. Blow your nose.\r\nGo to sleep, pet; you\u2019ll forget all about it in the\r\nmorning. I tried to explain to Father but he was too\r\nupset to listen tonight.\u201d\r\nBut the child never forgot. Next time she saw\r\nhim she quickly put both hands behind her back\r\nand a red colour flew into her cheeks.\r\n9. The Macdonalds lived next door. They had five\r\nchildren. Looking through a gap in the fence the\r\nlittle girl saw them playing \u2018tag\u2019 in the evening.\r\nThe father with the baby, Mao, on his shoulders,\r\ntwo little girls hanging on to his coat pockets\r\nran round and round the flower-beds, shaking\r\nwith laughter. Once she saw the boys turn the\r\nhose on him\u2014and he tried to catch them laughing\r\nall the time.\r\nThen it was she decided there were different\r\nsorts of fathers.\r\nSuddenly, one day, Mother became ill, and she\r\nand Grandmother went to hospital.\r\nThe little girl was left alone in the house with\r\nAlice, the cook. That was all right in the daytime,\r\nbut while Alice was putting her to bed she grew\r\nsuddenly afraid.\r\n10. \u201cWhat\u2019ll I do if I have a nightmare?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\r\noften have nightmares and then Grannie takes me\r\ninto her bed\u2014I can\u2019t stay in the dark\u2014it all gets\r\n\u2018whispery\u2019\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cYou just go to sleep, child,\u201d said Alice, pulling\r\noff her socks, \u201cand don\u2019t you scream and wake your\r\npoor Pa.\u201d\r\nBut the same old nightmare came \u2014 the butcher\r\nwith a knife and a rope, who came nearer and\r\nnearer, smiling that dreadful smile, while she could\r\nnot move, could only stand still, crying out,\r\n\u201cGrandma! Grandma!\u201d She woke shivering to see\r\nFather beside her bed, a candle in his hand.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he said.\r\n11. \u201cOh, a butcher \u2014 a knife \u2014 I want Grannie.\u201d He\r\nblew out the candle, bent down and caught up the\r\nchild in his arms, carrying her along the passage\r\nto the big bedroom. A newspaper was on the bed.\r\nHe put away the paper, then carefully tucked up\r\nthe child. He lay down beside her. Half asleep still,\r\nstill with the butcher\u2019s smile all about her it seemed,\r\nshe crept close to him, snuggled her head under\r\nhis arm, held tightly to his shirt.\r\nThen the dark did not matter; she lay still.\r\n\u201cHere, rub your feet against my legs and get\r\nthem warm,\u201d said Father.\r\n12. Tired out, he slept before the little girl. A funny feeling\r\ncame over her. Poor Father, not so big, after all \u2014\r\nand with no one to look after him. He was harder\r\nthan Grandmother, but it was a nice hardness. And\r\nevery day he had to work and was too tired to be a\r\nMr Macdonald\u2026 She had torn up all his beautiful\r\nwriting\u2026 She stirred suddenly, and sighed.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked her father. \u201cAnother\r\ndream?\u201d\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the little girl, \u201cmy head\u2019s on your heart.\r\nI can hear it going. What a big heart you\u2019ve got,\r\nFather dear.\u201d",

        "content": "ALBERT Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 in the\r\nGerman city of Ulm, without any indication that he\r\nwas destined for greatness. On the contrary, his\r\nmother thought Albert was a freak. To her, his head\r\nseemed much too large.\r\n2. At the age of two-and-a-half, Einstein still wasn\u2019t\r\ntalking. When he finally did learn to speak, he uttered\r\neverything twice. Einstein did not know what to do\r\nwith other children, and his playmates called him\r\n\u201cBrother Boring.\u201d So the youngster played by himself much of the time. He especially loved mechanical\r\ntoys. Looking at his newborn sister, Maja, he is said\r\nto have said: \u201cFine, but where are her wheels?\u201d\r\n\r\nOtto Neugebauer, the historian of ancient mathematics, told a\r\nstory about the boy Einstein that he characterises as a \u201clegend\u201d,\r\nbut that seems fairly authentic. As he was a late talker, his parents\r\nwere worried. At last, at the supper table one night, he broke his\r\nsilence to say, \u201cThe soup is too hot.\u201d Greatly relieved, his parents\r\nasked why he had never said a word before. Albert replied,\r\n\u201cBecause up to now everything was in order.\u201d\r\nA headmaster once told his father that what\r\nEinstein chose as a profession wouldn\u2019t matter,\r\nbecause \u201che\u2019ll never make a success at anything.\u201d\r\nEinstein began learning to play the violin at the\r\nage of six, because his mother wanted him to; he\r\nlater became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining\r\nthis skill throughout his life.\r\n4. But Albert Einstein was not a bad pupil. He went\r\nto high school in Munich, where Einstein\u2019s family\r\nhad moved when he was 15 months old, and scored\r\ngood marks in almost every subject. Einstein hated\r\nthe school\u2019s regimentation, and often clashed with\r\nhis teachers. At the age of 15, Einstein felt so stifled\r\nthere that he left the school for good.\r\n5. The previous year, Albert\u2019s parents had moved to\r\nMilan, and left their son with relatives. After prolonged\r\ndiscussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his\r\neducation in German-speaking Switzerland, in a city\r\nwhich was more liberal than Munich.\r\n6. Einstein was highly gifted in mathematics and\r\ninterested in physics, and after finishing school,\r\nhe decided to study at a university in Zurich. But\r\nscience wasn\u2019t the only thing that appealed to the\r\ndashing young man with the walrus moustache.\r\nHe also felt a special interest in a fellow student,\r\nMileva Maric, whom he found to be a \u201cclever\r\ncreature.\u201d This young Serb had come to Switzerland\r\nbecause the University in Zurich was one of the few\r\nin Europe where women could get degrees. Einstein\r\nsaw in her an ally against the \u201cphilistines\u201d\u2014\r\nthose people in his family and at the university\r\nwith whom he was constantly at odds. The couple\r\nfell in love. Letters survive in which they put their\r\naffection into words, mixing science with\r\ntenderness. Wrote Einstein: \u201cHow happy and proud\r\nI shall be when we both have brought our work on\r\nrelativity to a victorious conclusion.\u201d\r\n8. In 1900, at the age of 21, Albert Einstein was a\r\nuniversity graduate and unemployed. He worked\r\nas a teaching assistant, gave private lessons and\r\nfinally secured a job in 1902 as a technical expert\r\nin the patent office in Bern. While he was supposed\r\nto be assessing other people\u2019s inventions, Einstein\r\nwas actually developing his own ideas in secret. He\r\nis said to have jokingly called his desk drawer at\r\nwork the \u201cbureau of theoretical physics.\u201d\r\n9. One of the famous papers of 1905 was Einstein\u2019s\r\nSpecial Theory of Relativity, according to which time\r\nand distance are not absolute. Indeed, two perfectly\r\naccurate clocks will not continue to show the same\r\ntime if they come together again after a journey if\r\none of them has been moving very fast relative to\r\nthe other. From this followed the world\u2019s most\r\nfamous formula which describes the relationship\r\nbetween mass and energy:\r\nE = mc2\r\n(In this mathematical equation, E stands for energy, m for mass\r\nand c for the speed of the light in a vacuum (about 300,000 km/s).\r\nWhile Einstein was solving the most difficult\r\nproblems in physics, his private life was\r\nunravelling. Albert had wanted to marry Mileva right\r\nafter finishing his studies, but his mother was\r\nagainst it. She thought Mileva, who was three years\r\nolder than her son, was too old for him. She was\r\nalso bothered by Mileva\u2019s intelligence. \u201cShe is a\r\nbook like you,\u201d his mother said. Einstein put the\r\nwedding off.\r\n11. The pair finally married in January 1903, and had\r\ntwo sons. But a few years later, the marriage\r\nfaltered. Mileva, meanwhile, was losing her\r\nintellectual ambition and becoming an unhappy\r\nhousewife. After years of constant fighting, the\r\ncouple finally divorced in 1919. Einstein married\r\nhis cousin Elsa the same year.\r\nEinstein\u2019s new personal chapter coincided with his\r\nrise to world fame. In 1915, he had published his\r\nGeneral Theory of Relativity, which provided a new\r\ninterpretation of gravity. An eclipse of the sun in\r\n1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein\r\nhad correctly calculated in advance the extent to\r\nwhich the light from fixed stars would be deflected\r\nthrough the sun\u2019s gravitational field. The newspapers\r\nproclaimed his work as \u201ca scientific revolution.\u201d\r\n13. Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics in\r\n1921. He was showered with honours and invitations\r\nfrom all over the world, and lauded by the press.\r\n\r\n14. When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933,\r\nEinstein emigrated to the United States. Five years\r\nlater, the discovery of nuclear fission in Berlin had\r\nAmerican physicists in an uproar. Many of them\r\nhad fled from Fascism, just as Einstein had, and\r\nnow they were afraid the Nazis could build and use\r\nan atomic bomb.\r\n15. At the urging of a colleague, Einstein wrote a letter\r\nto the American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt,\r\non 2 August 1939, in which he warned: \u201cA single\r\nbomb of this type . . . exploded in a port, might very\r\nwell destroy the whole port together with some of\r\nthe surrounding territory.\u201d His words did not fail to\r\nhave an effect. The Americans developed the atomic\r\nbomb in a secret project of their own, and dropped\r\nit on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\r\nin August 1945.\r\n16. Einstein was deeply shaken by the extent of the\r\ndestruction. This time he wrote a public missive to\r\nthe United Nations. In it he proposed the formation\r\nof a world government. Unlike the letter to Roosevelt,\r\nthis one made no impact. But over the next decade,\r\nEinstein got ever more involved in politics \u2014\r\nagitating for an end to the arms buildup and using\r\nhis popularity to campaign for peace and democracy.\r\n17. When Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76, he\r\nwas celebrated as a visionary and world citizen as\r\nmuch as a scientific genius.;\r\n",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "\u201cHas a snake ever coiled itself round any part of your body? A full-blooded cobra?\u201d All of us fell silent.\r\nThe question came from the homeopath. The topic came up when we were discussing snakes. We listened attentively as the doctor continued with his tale.\r\nIt was a hot summer night; about ten o\u2019clock. I had my meal at the restaurant and returned to my room.\r\nI heard a noise from above as I opened the door.\r\nThe sound was a familiar one. One could say that the rats and I shared the room. I took out my box of matches and lighted the kerosene lamp on the table.\r\n2. The house was not electrified; it was a small rented room. I had just set up medical practice and my earnings were meagre. I had about sixty rupees in my suitcase. Along with some shirts and dhotis, I\r\nalso possessed one solitary black coat which I was then wearing.\r\n3. I took off my black coat, white shirt and not-so-white vest and hung them up. I opened the two windows in the room. It was an outer room with one wall facing the open yard. It had a tiled roof\r\nwith long supporting gables that rested on the beam over the wall. There was no ceiling. There was a regular traffic of rats to and from the beam. I made my bed and pulled it close to the wall. I lay down but I could not sleep. I got up and went out to the veranda for a little air, but the wind god seemed to have taken time off.\r\n4. I went back into the room and sat down on the chair. I opened the box beneath the table and took\r\nout a book, the Materia Medica. I opened it at the table on which stood the lamp and a large mirror; a\r\nsmall comb lay beside the mirror.\r\nOne feels tempted to look into a mirror when it is near one. I took a look. In those days I was a great admirer of beauty and I believed in making myself look handsome. I was unmarried and I was a doctor.\r\nI felt I had to make my presence felt. I picked up the comb and ran it through my hair and adjusted the parting so that it looked straight and neat.\r\nAgain I heard that sound from above.\r\n5. I took a close look at my face in the mirror. I made an important decision \u2014 I would shave daily and grow a thin moustache to look more handsome. I was after all a bachelor, and a doctor!\r\nI looked into the mirror and smiled. It was an attractive smile. I made another earth-shaking decision. I would always keep that attractive smile on my face . .. to look more handsome. I was after\r\nall a bachelor, and a doctor too on top of it!\r\nAgain came that noise from above.\r\n6. I got up, paced up and down the room. Then another lovely thought struck me. I would marry. \r\nI would get married to a woman doctor who had plenty of money and a good medical practice. She had to be fat; for a valid reason. If I made some silly mistake and needed to run away she should not be\r\nable to run after me and catch me!\r\nWith such thoughts in my mind I resumed my seat in the chair in front of the table. There were no more sounds from above. Suddenly there came a dull thud as if a rubber tube had fallen to the\r\nground ... surely nothing to worry about. Even so I thought I would turn around and take a look. No sooner had I turned than a fat snake wriggled over the back of the chair and landed on my shoulder.\r\nThe snake\u2019s landing on me and my turning were simultaneous.\r\n7. I didn\u2019t jump. I didn\u2019t tremble. I didn\u2019t cry out. There was no time to do any such thing. The snake slithered along my shoulder and coiled around my left arm above the elbow. The hood was spread out and its head was hardly three or four inches from my face!\r\nIt would not be correct to say merely that I sat there holding my breath. I was turned to stone. But my mind was very active. The door opened into darkness. The room was surrounded by darkness.\r\nIn the light of the lamp I sat there like a stone image in the flesh.\r\n8. I felt then the great presence of the creator of this world and this universe. God was there. Suppose I said something and he did not like it . . .\r\nI tried in my imagination to write in bright letters outside my little heart the words, \u2018O God\u2019.\r\nThere was some pain in my left arm. It was as if a thick leaden rod \u2014 no, a rod made of molten fire \u2014 was slowly but powerfully crushing my arm. The arm was beginning to be drained of all strength.\r\nWhat could I do?\r\n9. At my slightest movement the snake would strike me! Death lurked four inches away. Suppose it struck, what was the medicine I had to take? There were no medicines in the room. I was but a poor,\r\nfoolish and stupid doctor. I forgot my danger and smiled feebly at myself.\r\nIt seemed as if God appreciated that. The snake turned its head. It looked into the mirror and saw its reflection. I do not claim that it was the first snake that had ever looked into a mirror. But it\r\nwas certain that the snake was looking into the mirror. Was it admiring its own beauty? Was it trying to make an important decision about growing a moustache or using eye shadow and mascara or\r\nwearing a vermilion spot on its forehead?\r\n10. I did not know anything for certain. What sex was this snake, was it male or female? I will never know; for the snake unwound itself from my arm and slowly slithered into my lap. From there it crept onto the table and moved towards the mirror. Perhaps it wanted to enjoy its reflection at closer quarters.\r\nI was no mere image cut in granite. I was suddenly a man of flesh and blood. Still holding my breath I got up from the chair. I quietly went out through the door into the veranda. From there I leapt into\r\nthe yard and ran for all I was worth.\r\n\u201cPhew !\u201d Each of us heaved a sigh of relief. Somebody asked, \u201cDoctor, is your wife very fat?\u201d\r\n11. \u201cNo,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cGod willed otherwise. My life companion is a thin reedy person with the gift of a sprinter.\u201d\r\nSomeone else asked, \u201cDoctor, when you ran did the snake follow you?\u201d\r\nThe doctor replied, \u201cI ran and ran till I reached a friend\u2019s house. Immediately I smeared oil all over myself and took a bath. I changed into fresh clothes.\r\nThe next morning at about eight-thirty I took my friend and one or two others to my room to move my things from there. But we found we had little to carry. Some thief had removed most of my things.\r\nThe room had been cleaned out! But not really, the thief had left behind one thing as a final insult!\u2019\r\n12. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked.\r\nThe doctor said, \u201cMy vest, the dirty one. The fellow had such a sense of cleanliness...! The rascal could have taken it and used it after washing it with soap and water.\u201d\r\n\u201cDid you see the snake the next day, doctor?\u201d \r\nThe doctor laughed, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it since. It was a snake which was taken with its own beauty!\u201d",

        "title": "My Childhood",
        "prologue": "",
        "content": "I WAS born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I\r\nam quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together.\r\n2. I was one of many children \u2014 a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.\r\nThe Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\u2019s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines in Dinamani.\r\nOur area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the War. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram , to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.\r\n4. Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self-discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood \u2014 Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves because of our religious differences and upbringing. \r\nIn fact, Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Later, he took over the priesthood of the Rameswaram temple from his father; Aravindan went into the business of arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasan became a catering contractor for the Southern Railways.\r\n5. During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony, our family used to arrange boats with a special platform for carrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriage site, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha which was near our house. Events from the Ramayana and from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories my mother and grandmother would tell the children in our family.\r\n6. One day when I was in the fifth standard at the Rameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher came to our class. I used to wear a cap which marked me as a Muslim, and I always sat in the front row next to Ramanadha Sastry, who wore the sacred thread. The new teacher could not stomach a Hindu priest\u2019s son sitting with a Muslim boy. In accordance with our social ranking as the new teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench. I felt very sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry. He looked utterly downcast as I shifted to my seat in the last row. The image of him weeping when I shifted to the last row left a lasting impression on me.\r\n7. After school, we went home and told our respective parents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. He bluntly asked the teacher to either apologise or quit the school and the island. Not only did the teacher regret his behaviour, but the strong sense of conviction Lakshmana Sastry conveyed ultimately reformed this young teacher.\r\nOn the whole, the small society of Rameswaram was very rigid in terms of the segregation of different social groups. However, my science teacher Sivasubramania Iyer, though an orthodox Brahmin with a very conservative wife, was something of a rebel. He did his best to break social barriers so that people from varying backgrounds could mingle easily. He used to spend hours with me and would say, \u201cKalam, I want you to develop so that you are on par with the highly educated people of the big cities.\u201d\r\n9. One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wife was horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being invited to dine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused to serve me in her kitchen. Sivasubramania Iyer was not perturbed, nor did he get angry with his wife, but instead, served me with his own hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. His wife watched us from behind the kitchen door. I wondered whether she had observed any difference in the way I ate rice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When I was leaving his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to join him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing my hesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying, \u201cOnce you decide to change the system, such problems have to be confronted.\u201d When I visited his house the next week, Sivasubramania Iyer\u2019s wife took me inside her kitchen and served me food with her own hands.\r\n10. Then the Second World War was over and India\u2019s freedom was imminent. \u201cIndians will build their own India,\u201d declared Gandhiji. The whole country was filled with an unprecedented optimism. I asked my father for permission to leave Rameswaram and study at the district headquarters in Ramanathapuram.\r\nHe told me as if thinking aloud, \u201cAbul ! I know you have to go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly across the sun, alone and without a nest?\u201d He quoted Khalil Gibran to my hesitant mother, \u201cYour children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life\u2019s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.\u201d",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "The only woman in the world who has scaled Mt Everest twice was born in a society where the birth of a son was regarded as a blessing, and a daughter, though not considered a curse, was not generally welcome. When her mother was expecting Santosh, a travelling \u2018holy man\u2019, giving her his blessing, assumed that she wanted a son.\r\nBut, to everyone\u2019s surprise, the unborn child\u2019s grandmother, who was standing close by, told him that they did not want a son. The \u2018holy man\u2019 was also surprised!\r\nNevertheless, he gave the requested blessing . .. and as destiny would have it, the blessing seemed to work.\r\nSantosh was born the sixth child in a family with five sons, a sister to five brothers. She was born in the small village of Joniyawas of Rewari District in Haryana.\r\n2. The girl was given the name \u2018Santosh\u2019, which means contentment. But Santosh was not always content with her place in a traditional way of life. She began living life on her own terms from the start. Where other girls wore traditional Indian dresses, Santosh preferred shorts. Looking back, she says now, \u201cFrom the very beginning I was quite determined that if I chose a correct and a rational path, the others around me had to change, not me.\u201d\r\n3. Santosh\u2019s parents were affluent landowners who could afford to send their children to the best schools, even to the country\u2019s capital, New Delhi, which was quite close by. But, in line with the prevailing custom in the family, Santosh had to make do with the local village school. So, she decided to fight the system in her own quiet way when the right moment arrived. And the right moment came when she turned sixteen. At sixteen, most of the girls in her village used to get married.\r\nSantosh was also under pressure from her parents to do the same.\r\n4. A marriage as early as that was the last thing on her mind. She threatened her parents that she would never marry if she did not get a proper education. She left home and got herself enrolled in a school in Delhi. When her parents refused to pay for her education, she politely informed them of her plans to earn money by working part time to pay her school fees. Her parents then agreed to pay for her education.\r\n5. Wishing always to study \u201ca bit more\u201d and with her father slowly getting used to her urge for more education, Santosh passed the high school examinations and went to Jaipur. She joined Maharani College and got a room in Kasturba Hostel. \r\nSantosh remembers, \u201cKasturba Hostel faced the Aravalli Hills. I used to watch villagers from my room,going up the hill and suddenly vanishing after a while. One day I decided to check it out myself. I found nobody except a few mountaineers. I asked if I could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they answered in the affirmative and motivated me to take to climbing.\u201d\r\n6. Then there was no looking back for this determined young girl. She saved money and enrolled in a course at Uttarkashi\u2019s Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. \u201cMy college semester in Jaipur was to end in April but it ended on the nineteenth of May. And I was supposed to be in Uttarkashi on the twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead, I headed straight for the training. I had to write a letter of apology to my father without whose permission I had got myself enrolled at Uttarkashi.\u201d\r\n7. Thereafter, Santosh went on an expedition every year. Her climbing skills matured rapidly. Also, she developed a remarkable resistance to cold and the altitude. Equipped with an iron will, physical endurance and an amazing mental toughness, she proved herself repeatedly. The culmination of her hard work and sincerity came in 1992, just four years after she had shyly asked the Aravalli mountaineers if she could join them.\r\nAt barely twenty years of age, Santosh Yadav scaled Mt Everest, becoming the youngest woman in the world to achieve the feat. If her climbing skills, physical fitness, and mental strength impressed her seniors, her concern for others and desire to work together with them found her a special place in the hearts of fellow climbers. During the 1992 Everest mission, Santosh Yadav provided special care to a climber who lay dying at the South Col. She was unfortunately unsuccessful in saving him. However, she managed to save another climber, Mohan Singh, who would have met with the same fate had she not shared her oxygen with him.\r\n9. Within twelve months, Santosh found herself a member of an Indo-Nepalese Women\u2019s Expedition that invited her to join them. She then scaled the Everest a second time, thus setting a record as the\r\nonly woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and securing for herself and India a unique place in the annals of mountaineering. In recognition of her achievements, the Indian government\r\nbestowed upon her one of the nation\u2019s top honours, the Padmashri.\r\n10. Describing her feelings when she was literally \u2018on top of the world\u2019, Santosh has said, \u201cIt took some time for the enormity of the moment to sink in... Then I unfurled the Indian tricolour and held it aloft on the roof of the world. The feeling is indescribable. The Indian flag was flying on top of the world. It was truly a spiritual moment. I felt proud as an Indian.\u201d\r\nAlso a fervent environmentalist, Santosh collected and brought down 500 kilograms of garbage from the Himalayas.",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "I GET a cheap room in the centre of town and sleep for hours. The next morning, with Mr Shah\u2019s son and nephew, I visit the two temples in Kathmandu that are most sacred to Hindus and Buddhists.\r\n2. At Pashupatinath (outside which a sign proclaims \u2018Entrance for the Hindus only\u2019) there is an atmosphere of \u2018febrile confusion\u2019. Priests, hawkers, devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons and dogs roam through the grounds. We offer a few flowers. There are so many worshippers that some people trying to get the priest\u2019s attention are elbowed aside by others pushing their way to the front. A rincess of the Nepalese royal house appears; everyone bows and makes way. By the main gate, a party of saffron-clad Westerners struggle for permission to enter. The policeman is not convinced that they are \u2018the Hindus\u2019 (only Hindus are allowed to enter the temple). A fight breaks out between two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps onto a shivalinga, then runs screaming around the temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati,that flows below. A corpse is being cremated on its banks; washerwomen are at their work and children bathe. From a balcony a basket of flowers and leaves, old offerings now  wilted, is dropped into the river. A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the river bank. When it emerges fully, the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period of the Kaliyug will end on earth. At the Baudhnath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of Kathmandu, there is, in contrast, a sense of stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a road. Small shops stand on its outer edge: many of these are owned by Tibetan immigrants; felt bags, Tibetan prints and silver jewellery can be bought here. There are no crowds: this is a haven of quietness in the busy streets around.\r\n4. Kathmandu is vivid, mercenary, religious, with small shrines to flower-adorned deities along the narrowest and busiest streets; with fruit sellers, flute sellers, hawkers of postcards; shops selling\r\nWestern cosmetics, film rolls and chocolate; or copper utensils and Nepalese antiques. Film songs blare out from the radios, car horns sound, bicycle bells ring, stray cows low questioningly at motorcycles, vendors shout out their wares. I indulge myself mindlessly: buy a bar of marzipan, a cornon-the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier on the pavement (rubbed with salt, chilli powder and lemon); a couple of love story comics, and even a Reader\u2019s Digest. All this I wash down with Coca Cola and a nauseating orange drink, and feel much the better for it.\r\n5. I consider what route I should take back home. If I were propelled by enthusiasm for travel per se, I would go by bus and train to Patna, then sail up the Ganges past Benaras to Allahabad, then up the\r\nYamuna, past Agra to Delhi. But I am too exhausted and homesick; today is the last day of August. Go home, I tell myself: move directly towards home. I enter a Nepal Airlines office and buy a ticket for\r\ntomorrow\u2019s flight.\r\n6. I look at the flute seller standing in a corner of the square near the hotel. In his hand is a pole with an attachment at the top from which fifty or sixty bansuris protrude in all directions, like the quills of a porcupine. They are of bamboo: there are crossflutes and recorders. From time to time he stands the pole on the ground, selects a flute and plays for a few minutes. The sound rises clearly above the noise of the traffic and the hawkers\u2019 cries. He plays slowly, meditatively, without excessive display. He does not shout out his wares. \r\nOccasionally he makes a sale, but in a curiously offhanded way as if this were incidental to his enterprise. Sometimes he breaks off playing to talk to the fruit seller. I imagine that this has been the\r\npattern of his life for years. \r\n7. I find it difficult to tear myself away from the square.\r\nFlute music always does this to me: it is at once the most universal and most particular of sounds.\r\nThere is no culture that does not have its flute\u2014 the reed neh, the recorder, the Japanese shakuhachi, the deep bansuri of Hindustani classical music, the clear or breathy flutes of South America, the high-pitched Chinese flutes. Each has its specific fingering and compass. It weaves its own associations. Yet to hear any flute is, it seems to me, to be drawn into the commonality of all mankind, to be moved by music closest in its phrases and sentences to the human voice. Its motive force too is living breath: it too needs to pause and breathe before it can go on.\r\n8. That I can be so affected by a few familiar phrases on the bansuri, surprises me at first, for on the previous occasions that I have returned home after a long absence abroad, I have hardly noticed such details, and certainly have not invested them with the significance I now do.",

        "content": "SCENE: A small cottage interior. There is an entrance back right (which\r\nmay be curtained). Another door to the left must be a practical door. The\r\nfurniture is simple, consisting of a small table towards the left, a chair or\r\ntwo, and a divan rather upstage on the right. On the table is a telephone.\r\n\r\n(When the curtain rises Gerrard is standing by the table making a phone\r\ncall. He is of medium height, and wearing horn-rimmed glasses . . . He\r\nis dressed in a lounge suit and a great coat. His voice is cultured.)\r\nGERRARD : . .. Well, tell him to phone up directly. I must know. ..\r\nYes, I expect I\u2019ll still be here, but you mustn\u2019t count on\r\nthat ... In about ten minutes\u2019 time. Right-ho. Goodbye.\r\n\r\n(He puts down the phone and goes to the divan on the left, where there\r\nis a travelling bag, and starts packing. Whilst he is thus engaged, another\r\nman, similar in build to Gerrard enters from the right silently \u2014 revolver\r\nin hand. He is flashily dressed in an overcoat and a soft hat. He bumps\r\naccidentally against the table, and at the sound Gerrard turns quickly.)\r\n\r\nGERRARD : (pleasantly) Why, this is a surprise, Mr\u2014 er\u2014\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019m glad you\u2019re pleased to see me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be\r\npleased for long. Put those paws up!\r\nGERRARD : This is all very melodramatic, not very original, perhaps,\r\nbut\u2026\r\nINTRUDER : Trying to be calm and \u2014er\u2014\r\nGERRARD : \u2018Nonchalant\u2019 is your word, I think.\r\nINTRUDER : Thanks a lot. You\u2019ll soon stop being smart. I\u2019ll make you\r\ncrawl. I want to know a few things, see.\r\nGERRARD : Anything you like. I know all the answers. But before we\r\nbegin I should like to change my position; you may be\r\ncomfortable, but I am not.\r\nINTRUDER : Sit down there, and no funny business. (Motions to a\r\nchair, and seats himself on the divan by the bag.) Now\r\nthen, we\u2019ll have a nice little talk about yourself!\r\nGERRARD : At last a sympathetic audience! I\u2019ll tell you the story of\r\nmy life. How as a child I was stolen by the gypsies, and\r\nwhy at the age of thirty-two, I find myself in my lonely\r\nEssex cottage, how ...\r\nINTRUDER : Keep it to yourself, and just answer my questions. You\r\nlive here alone? Well, do you?\r\nGERRARD : I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were telling me, not asking me.\r\nA question of inflection; your voice is unfamiliar.\r\nINTRUDER : (with emphasis) Do you live here alone?\r\nGERRARD : And if I don\u2019t answer?\r\nINTRUDER : You\u2019ve got enough sense not to want to get hurt.\r\nGERRARD : I think good sense is shown more in the ability to avoid\r\npain than in the mere desire to do so. What do you think,\r\nMr\u2014 er\u2014\r\nINTRUDER : Never mind my name. I like yours better, Mr Gerrard.\r\nWhat are your Christian names?\r\nGERRARD : Vincent Charles.\r\nINTRUDER : Do you run a car?\r\nGERRARD :No.\r\nINTRUDER : That\u2019s a lie. You\u2019re not dealing with a fool. I\u2019m as smart\r\nas you and smarter, and I know you run a car. Better be\r\ncareful, wise guy!\r\nGERRARD : Are you American, or is that merely a clever imitation?\r\nINTRUDER : Listen, this gun\u2019s no toy. I can hurt you without killing\r\nyou, and still get my answers.\r\nGERRARD : Of course, if you put it like that, I\u2019ll be glad to assist you.\r\nI do possess a car, and it\u2019s in the garage round the corner.\r\nINTRUDER : That\u2019s better. Do people often come out here?\r\nGERRARD : Very rarely. Surprisingly few people take the trouble to\r\nvisit me. There\u2019s the baker and the greengrocer, of course;\r\nand then there\u2019s the milkman \u2014 quite charming, but no\r\none so interesting as yourself.\r\nINTRUDER : I happen to know that you never see tradespeople.\r\nGERRARD : You seem to have taken a considerable amount of trouble.\r\nSince you know so much about me, won\u2019t you say\r\nsomething about yourself? You have been so modest.\r\nINTRUDER : I could tell you plenty. You think you\u2019re smart, but I\u2019m\r\nthe top of the class round here. I\u2019ve got brains and I use\r\nthem. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve got where I have.\r\nGERRARD : And where precisely have you got? It didn\u2019t require a\r\ngreat brain to break into my little cottage.\r\nINTRUDER : When you know why I\u2019ve broken into your little cottage,\r\nyou\u2019ll be surprised, and it won\u2019t be a pleasant surprise.\r\nGERRARD : With you figuring so largely in it, that is understandable.\r\nBy the way, what particular line of crime do you embrace,\r\nor aren\u2019t you a specialist?\r\nINTRUDER : My speciality\u2019s jewel robbery. Your car will do me a treat.\r\nIt\u2019s certainly a dandy bus.\r\nGERRARD : I\u2019m afraid jewels are few and far between in the wilds of\r\nEssex.\r\nINTRUDER : So are the cops. I can retire here nicely for a little while.\r\nGERRARD : You mean to live with me? A trifle sudden isn\u2019t it; you\u2019ve\r\nnot been invited.\r\nINTRUDER : You won\u2019t be here long; so I didn\u2019t trouble to ask.\r\nGERRARD : What do you mean?\r\nINTRUDER : This is your big surprise. I\u2019m going to kill you.\r\nGERRARD : A little harsh, isn\u2019t it?\r\nINTRUDER : (with heavy sarcasm) Yeah, I\u2019ll be sorry to do it. I\u2019ve taken\r\na fancy to you, but it\u2019s just got to be done.\r\nGERRARD : Why add murder to your other crimes? It\u2019s a grave step\r\nyou\u2019re taking.\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019m not taking it for fun. I\u2019ve been hunted long enough.\r\nI\u2019m wanted for murder already, and they can\u2019t hang me\r\ntwice.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019re planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted\r\nyou\u2019ve nothing to lose, but what have you to gain?\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019ve got freedom to gain. As for myself, I\u2019m a poor hunted\r\nrat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I\u2019m free to go places and\r\ndo nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having\r\nto be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop.\r\nGERRARD : In most melodramas the villain is foolish enough to delay\r\nhis killing long enough to be frustrated. You are much\r\nluckier.\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019m O.K. I\u2019ve got a reason for everything. I\u2019m going to be\r\nVincent Charles Gerrard, see. I\u2019ve got to know what he\r\ntalks like. Now I know. That posh stuff comes easy. This\r\nis Mr V.C. Gerrard speaking. (Pantomime of phoning, in\r\nimitation cultured voice.) And that\u2019s not all. (He stands\r\nup.) Get up a minute (Gerrard stands.) Now take a look at\r\nme.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019re not particularly decorative.\r\nINTRUDER : No! Well, that goes for you, too. I\u2019ve only got to wear\r\nspecs and I\u2019ll be enough like you to get away with it.\r\nGERRARD : What about your clothes? They\u2019ll let you down if you\u2019re\r\nnot careful.\r\nINTRUDER : That\u2019ll be all right. Yours will fit me fine.\r\nGERRARD : That is extremely interesting, but you seem to miss the\r\npoint of my remark. I said, you were luckier than most\r\nmelodramatic villains. It was not a tribute to your\r\nintelligence. You won\u2019t kill me for a very good reason.\r\nINTRUDER : So that\u2019s what you think.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019ll let me go, and thank God you didn\u2019t shoot sooner.\r\nINTRUDER : Come on. What\u2019s on your mind! Better be quick. This\r\nconversation bores me.\r\nGERRARD : Your idea is to elude the police by killing me and taking\r\non my identity?\r\nINTRUDER : Yes, I like the idea.\r\nGERRARD : But are you sure it\u2019s going to help you?\r\nINTRUDER : Now listen here. I\u2019ve got this all planned. I did a job in\r\ntown. Things went wrong and I killed a cop. Since then\r\nI\u2019ve done nothing but dodge.\r\nGERRARD : And this is where dodging has brought you?\r\nINTRUDER : It brought me to Aylesbury. That\u2019s where I saw you in the\r\ncar. Two other people saw you and started to talk. I\r\nlistened. It looks like you\u2019re a bit queer \u2014 kind of a mystery\r\nman.\r\nGERRARD : A mystery which I propose to explain.\r\nINTRUDER : (disregarding him) You phone your orders and sometimes\r\nyou go away suddenly and come back just the same.\r\nThose are just the things I want to do. Hearing about you\r\nwas one of my luckiest breaks.\r\nGERRARD : Apparently you haven\u2019t the intelligence to ask why I am\r\ninvested in this cloak of mystery.\r\nINTRUDER : (preparing to shoot) As I said before, this conversation\r\nbores me.\r\nGERRARD : Don\u2019t be a fool. If you shoot, you\u2019ll hang for sure. If not as\r\nyourself, then as Vincent Charles Gerrard.\r\nINTRUDER : What is this?\r\nGERRARD : This is your big surprise. I said you wouldn\u2019t kill me and\r\nI was right. Why do you think I am here today and gone\r\ntomorrow, never see tradespeople? You say my habits\r\nwould suit you. You are a crook. Do you think I am a\r\nSunday-school teacher?\r\nThe game\u2019s up as far as I\u2019m concerned. Things went\r\nwrong with me. I said it with bullets and got away.\r\nUnfortunately they got one of my men, and found things\r\nthe fool should have burnt. Tonight I\u2019m expecting trouble.\r\nMy bag\u2019s packed ready to clear off. There it is.\r\nINTRUDER : It\u2019s a bag all right and\r\nthis is a gun all right.\r\nWhat\u2019s all this?\r\nGERRARD : That\u2019s a disguise outfit;\r\nfalse moustaches and\r\nwhat not. Now do you\r\nbelieve me?\r\nINTRUDER : (musingly) I don\u2019t know.\r\nGERRARD : For God\u2019s sake clear\r\nthat muddled head of\r\nyours and let\u2019s go.\r\nCome with me in the\r\ncar. I can use you. If you\r\nfind it\u2019s a frame, you\u2019ve\r\ngot me in the car, and\r\nyou\u2019ve still got your gun.\r\nINTRUDER : May be you\u2019re right.\r\nGERRARD : Then don\u2019t waste time.\r\n(Goes and picks up hat\r\nand bag.)\r\nINTRUDER : Careful, boss, I\u2019m\r\nwatching you.\r\nGERRARD : I have got a man posted\r\non the main road. He\u2019ll\r\nring up if he sees the police, but I don\u2019t want to leave ... (telephone bell rings)\r\nCome on! They\u2019re after us. Through here straight to\r\nthe garage.\r\nINTRUDER : How do I know that you are telling the truth?\r\nGERRARD : Oh, don\u2019t be a fool. Look for yourself.\r\n(Gerrard opens door and steps away. Intruder leans forward\r\nto inspect it, with his side towards Gerrard, but with the\r\nrevolver ready. As he turns his head, Gerrard gives him a\r\npush into the cupboard, knocking the revolver out of his\r\nhand. He slams the door and locks it, picks up the revolver\r\nand goes to the phone, where he stands with the gun pointed\r\nat the cupboard door.)\r\nINTRUDER : (rattles door and shouts) Let me out of here!\r\nGERRARD : Hello. Yes, speaking. Sorry I can\u2019t let you have the props\r\nin time for rehearsal, I\u2019ve had a spot of bother \u2014 quite\r\namusing. I think I\u2019ll put it in my next play. Listen, can\r\nyou tell our friend the Sergeant to come up here at once?\r\nYou\u2019ll probably find him in the Public Bar.",

I\u2019ve been hunted long enough.\r\nI\u2019m wanted for murder already, and they can\u2019t hang me\r\ntwice.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019re planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted\r\nyou\u2019ve nothing to lose, but what have you to gain?\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019ve got freedom to gain. As for myself, I\u2019m a poor hunted\r\nrat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I\u2019m free to go places and\r\ndo nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having\r\nto be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop.\r\nGERRARD : In most melodramas the villain is foolish enough to delay\r\nhis killing long enough to be frustrated. You are much\r\nluckier.\r\nINTRUDER : I\u2019m O.K. I\u2019ve got a reason for everything. I\u2019m going to be\r\nVincent Charles Gerrard, see. I\u2019ve got to know what he\r\ntalks like. Now I know. That posh stuff comes easy. This\r\nis Mr V.C. Gerrard speaking. (Pantomime of phoning, in\r\nimitation cultured voice.) And that\u2019s not all. (He stands\r\nup.) Get up a minute (Gerrard stands.) Now take a look at\r\nme.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019re not particularly decorative.\r\nINTRUDER : No! Well, that goes for you, too. I\u2019ve only got to wear\r\nspecs and I\u2019ll be enough like you to get away with it.\r\nGERRARD : What about your clothes? They\u2019ll let you down if you\u2019re\r\nnot careful.\r\nINTRUDER : That\u2019ll be all right. Yours will fit me fine.\r\nGERRARD : That is extremely interesting, but you seem to miss the\r\npoint of my remark. I said, you were luckier than most\r\nmelodramatic villains. It was not a tribute to your\r\nintelligence. You won\u2019t kill me for a very good reason.\r\nINTRUDER : So that\u2019s what you think.\r\nGERRARD : You\u2019ll let me go, and thank God you didn\u2019t shoot sooner.\r\nINTRUDER : Come on. What\u2019s on your mind! Better be quick. This\r\nconversation bores me.\r\nGERRARD : Your idea is to elude the police by killing me and taking\r\non my identity?\r\nINTRUDER : Yes, I like the idea.\r\nGERRARD : But are you sure it\u2019s going to help you?\r\nINTRUDER : Now listen here. I\u2019ve got this all planned. I did a job in\r\ntown. Things went wrong and I killed a cop. Since then\r\nI\u2019ve done nothing but dodge.\r\nGERRARD : And this is where dodging has brought you?\r\nINTRUDER : It brought me to Aylesbury. That\u2019s where I saw you in the\r\ncar. Two other people saw you and started to talk. I\r\nlistened. It looks like you\u2019re a bit queer \u2014 kind of a mystery\r\nman.\r\nGERRARD : A mystery which I propose to explain.\r\nINTRUDER : (disregarding him) You phone your orders and sometimes\r\nyou go away suddenly and come back just the same.\r\nThose are just the things I want to do. Hearing about you\r\nwas one of my luckiest breaks.\r\nGERRARD : Apparently you haven\u2019t the intelligence to ask why I am\r\ninvested in this cloak of mystery.\r\nINTRUDER : (preparing to shoot) As I said before, this conversation\r\nbores me.\r\nGERRARD : Don\u2019t be a fool. If you shoot, you\u2019ll hang for sure. If not as\r\nyourself, then as Vincent Charles Gerrard.\r\nINTRUDER : What is this?\r\nGERRARD : This is your big surprise. I said you wouldn\u2019t kill me and\r\nI was right. Why do you think I am here today and gone\r\ntomorrow, never see tradespeople? You say my habits\r\nwould suit you. You are a crook. Do you think I am a\r\nSunday-school teacher?\r\nThe game\u2019s up as far as I\u2019m concerned. Things went\r\nwrong with me. I said it with bullets and got away.\r\nUnfortunately they got one of my men, and found things\r\nthe fool should have burnt. Tonight I\u2019m expecting trouble.\r\nMy bag\u2019s packed ready to clear off. There it is.\r\nINTRUDER : It\u2019s a bag all right and\r\nthis is a gun all right.\r\nWhat\u2019s all this?\r\nGERRARD : That\u2019s a disguise outfit;\r\nfalse moustaches and\r\nwhat not. Now do you\r\nbelieve me?\r\nINTRUDER : (musingly) I don\u2019t know.\r\nGERRARD : For God\u2019s sake clear\r\nthat muddled head of\r\nyours and let\u2019s go.\r\nCome with me in the\r\ncar. I can use you. If you\r\nfind it\u2019s a frame, you\u2019ve\r\ngot me in the car, and\r\nyou\u2019ve still got your gun.\r\nINTRUDER : May be you\u2019re right.\r\nGERRARD : Then don\u2019t waste time.\r\n(Goes and picks up hat\r\nand bag.)\r\nINTRUDER : Careful, boss, I\u2019m\r\nwatching you.\r\nGERRARD : I have got a man posted\r\non the main road. He\u2019ll\r\nring up if he sees the police, but I don\u2019t want to leave ... (telephone bell rings)\r\nCome on! They\u2019re after us. Through here straight to\r\nthe garage.\r\nINTRUDER : How do I know that you are telling the truth?\r\nGERRARD : Oh, don\u2019t be a fool. Look for yourself.\r\n(Gerrard opens door and steps away. Intruder leans forward\r\nto inspect it, with his side towards Gerrard, but with the\r\nrevolver ready. As he turns his head, Gerrard gives him a\r\npush into the cupboard, knocking the revolver out of his\r\nhand. He slams the door and locks it, picks up the revolver\r\nand goes to the phone, where he stands with the gun pointed\r\nat the cupboard door.)\r\nINTRUDER : (rattles door and shouts) Let me out of here!\r\nGERRARD : Hello. Yes, speaking. Sorry I can\u2019t let you have the props\r\nin time for rehearsal, I\u2019ve had a spot of bother \u2014 quite\r\namusing. I think I\u2019ll put it in my next play. Listen, can\r\nyou tell our friend the Sergeant to come up here at once?\r\nYou\u2019ll probably find him in the Public Bar.",

Gerrard implied that he was a man on the run, and the intruder, desperate for a way to escape the police, believed that Gerrard\u2019s lifestyle mirrored his own.

        "content": "THE house \u2014 the only one in the entire valley \u2014 sat\r\non the crest of a low hill. From this height one\r\ncould see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted\r\nwith the flowers that always promised a good\r\nharvest. The only thing the earth needed was a\r\ndownpour or at least a shower. Throughout the\r\nmorning Lencho \u2014 who knew his fields intimately\r\n\u2014 had done nothing else but see the sky towards\r\nthe north-east.\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019re really going to get some water, woman.\u201d\r\nThe woman who was preparing supper, replied,\r\n\u201cYes, God willing\u201d. The older boys were working in\r\nthe field, while the smaller ones were playing near\r\nthe house until the woman called to them all, \u201cCome\r\nfor dinner\u201d. It was during the meal that, just as\r\nLencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to\r\nfall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds\r\ncould be seen approaching. The air was fresh and\r\nsweet. The man went out for no other reason than\r\nto have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,\r\nand when he returned he exclaimed, \u2018\u2018These aren\u2019t\r\nraindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\r\nThe big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones\r\nare fives.\u2019\u2019\r\nWith a satisfied expression he regarded the field\r\nof ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of\r\nrain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow\r\nand along with the rain very large hailstones began\r\nto fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.\r\nThe boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out\r\nto collect the frozen pearls.\r\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s really getting bad now,\u2019\u2019 exclaimed the man.\r\n\u201cI hope it passes quickly.\u201d It did not pass quickly.\r\nFor an hour the hail rained on the house, the\r\ngarden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole\r\nvalley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.\r\nNot a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was\r\ntotally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the\r\nplants. Lencho\u2019s soul was filled with sadness. When\r\nthe storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the\r\nfield and said to his sons, \u201cA plague of locusts would\r\nhave left more than this. The hail has left nothing.\r\nThis year we will have no corn.\u2019\u2019\r\nThat night was a sorrowful one.\r\n\u201cAll our work, for nothing.\u201d\r\n\u2018\u2018There\u2019s no one who can help us.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all go hungry this year.\u201d\t\r\nBut in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary\r\nhouse in the middle of the valley, there was a single\r\nhope: help from God.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, even though this seems like\r\na total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.\u201d\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they say: no one dies of hunger.\u201d\r\nAll through the night, Lencho thought only of\r\nhis one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he\r\nhad been instructed, see everything, even what is\r\ndeep in one\u2019s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a\r\nman, working like an animal in the fields, but still\r\nhe knew how to write. The following Sunday, at\r\ndaybreak, he began to write a letter which he\r\nhimself would carry to town and place in the mail.\r\nIt was nothing less than a letter to God.\r\n\u201cGod,\u201d he wrote, \u201cif you don\u2019t help me, my family\r\nand I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred\r\npesos in order to sow my field again and to live\r\nuntil the crop comes, because the hailstorm... .\u201d\r\nHe wrote \u2018To God\u2019 on the envelope, put the letter\r\ninside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post\r\noffice, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped\r\nit into the mailbox.\r\nOne of the employees, who was a postman and\r\nalso helped at the post office, went to his boss\r\nlaughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.\r\nNever in his career as a postman had he known\r\nthat address. The postmaster \u2014 a fat, amiable\r\nfellow \u2014 also broke out laughing, but almost\r\nimmediately he turned serious and, tapping the\r\nletter on his desk, commented, \u201cWhat faith! I wish I\r\nhad the faith of the man who wrote this letter.\r\nStarting up a correspondence with God!\u201d\r\nSo, in order not to shake the writer\u2019s faith in God,\r\nthe postmaster came up with an idea: answer the\r\nletter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to\r\nanswer it he needed something more than goodwill,\r\nink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he\r\nasked for money from his employees, he himself gave\r\npart of his salary, and several friends of his were\r\nobliged to give something \u2018for an act of charity\u2019.\r\nIt was impossible for him to gather together the\r\nhundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer\r\nonly a little more than half. He put the money in an\r\nenvelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter\r\ncontaining only a single word as a signature: God.\r\nThe following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier\r\nthan usual to ask if there was a letter for him.\r\nIt was the postman himself who handed the letter\r\nto him while the postmaster, experiencing the\r\ncontentment of a man who has performed a good\r\ndeed, looked on from his office.\r\nLencho showed not the slightest surprise on\r\nseeing the money; such was his confidence \u2014 but\r\nhe became angry when he counted the money. God\r\ncould not have made a mistake, nor could he have\r\ndenied Lencho what he had requested.\r\nImmediately, Lencho went up to the window to\r\nask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,\r\nhe started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,\r\ncaused by the effort he had to make to express his\r\nideas. When he finished, he went to the window to\r\nbuy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to\r\nthe envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment\r\nthe letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went\r\nto open it. It said: \u201cGod: Of the money that I asked\r\nfor, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the\r\nrest, since I need it very much. But don\u2019t send it to\r\nme through the mail because the post office\r\nemployees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.\u201d;",

        "content": "TENTH May dawned bright and clear. For the past few days I had been pleasantly besieged by dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to pay their respects before the inauguration. The inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of international leaders on South African soil.\r\nThe ceremonies took place in the lovely sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and nations for the installation of South Africa\u2019s first democratic, non-racial government.\r\nOn that lovely autumn day I was accompanied by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr de Klerk was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president.\r\nWhen it was my turn, I pledged to obey and uphold the Constitution and to devote myself to the wellbeing of the Republic and its people. To the assembled guests and the watching world, I said: Today, all of us do, by our presence here... confer glory and hope to newborn liberty. Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.\r\nWe, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own soil. We thank all of our distinguished international guests for having come to take possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.\r\nWe have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. \r\nWe pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination. \r\nNever, never, and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.\r\nThe sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement.\r\nLet freedom reign. God bless Africa! \r\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in awe as a spectacular array of South African jets, helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only a display of pinpoint precision and military force, but a demonstration of the military\u2019s loyalty to democracy, to a new government that had been freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the highest generals of the South African defence force and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that not so many years before they would not have saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue and gold of the new South African flag.\r\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of our two national anthems, and the vision of whites singing \u2018Nkosi Sikelel \u2013iAfrika\u2019 and blacks singing \u2018Die Stem\u2019, the old anthem of the Republic. Although\r\nthat day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem they once despised, they would soon know the words by heart.\r\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth, the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their own land. The structure they created formed the basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane, societies the world has ever known. Now, in the last decade of the twentieth century, and my own eighth decade as a man, that system had been overturned forever and replaced by one that recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of the colour of their skin.\r\nThat day had come about through the unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people, people whose suffering and courage can never be counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so many other days, that I was simply the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before me. That long and noble line ended and now began again with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank them and that they were not able to see what their sacrifices had wrought. \r\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations, recovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of \r\noppression and brutality had another, unintended, effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time* \u2014 men of such extraordinary courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depths of oppression to create such heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer and truer than the purest diamonds.\r\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I have seen men and women risk and give their lives for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks and torture without breaking, showing a strength and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\r\nNo one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love \r\ncomes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards, perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to reassure me and keep me going. Man\u2019s goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.\r\nIn life, every man has twin obligations \u2014 obligations to his family, to his parents, to his wife and children; and he has an obligation to his people, his community, his country. In a civil and humane society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations according to his own inclinations and abilities. But in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of colour who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father and a husband.\r\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free \u2014 free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mother\u2019s hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my  village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God.\r\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family \u2014 the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life.\r\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self-respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free.\r\nFreedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me.\r\nI knew that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man\u2019s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness.\r\nI am not truly free if I am taking away someone else\u2019s freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.",

        "content": "His First Flight\r\n\r\nTHE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two\r\nbrothers and his sister had already flown away the\r\nday before. He had been afraid to fly with them.\r\nSomehow when he had taken a little run forward to\r\nthe brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his\r\nwings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea\r\nstretched down beneath, and it was such a long\r\nway down \u2014 miles down. He felt certain that his\r\nwings would never support him; so he bent his head\r\nand ran away back to the little hole under the ledge\r\nwhere he slept at night. Even when each of his\r\nbrothers and his little sister, whose wings were far\r\nshorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their\r\nwings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage\r\nto take that plunge which appeared to him so\r\ndesperate. His father and mother had come around\r\ncalling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening\r\nto let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.\r\nBut for the life of him he could not move.\r\nThat was twenty-four hours ago. Since then\r\nnobody had come near him. The day before, all day\r\nlong, he had watched his parents flying about with\r\nhis brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art\r\nof flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and\r\nhow to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older\r\nbrother catch his first herring and devour it,\r\nstanding on a rock, while his parents circled around\r\nraising a proud cackle. And all the morning the\r\nwhole family had walked about on the big plateau\r\nmidway down the opposite cliff taunting him with\r\nhis cowardice.\r\nThe sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on\r\nhis ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat\r\nbecause he had not eaten since the previous nightfall.\r\nHe stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge,\r\nand standing on one leg with the other leg hidden\r\nunder his wing, he closed one eye, then the other,\r\nand pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took\r\nno notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his\r\nsister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads\r\nsunk into their necks. His father was preening the\r\nfeathers on his white back. Only his mother was\r\nlooking at him. She was standing on a little high\r\nhump on the plateau, her white breast thrust\r\nforward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish\r\nthat lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of\r\nher beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened\r\nhim. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping\r\nhis beak now and again to whet it.\r\n\u201cGa, ga, ga,\u201d he cried begging her to bring him\r\nsome food. \u201cGaw-col-ah,\u201d she screamed back\r\nderisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and\r\nafter a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream.\r\nHis mother had picked up a piece of the fish and\r\nwas flying across to him with it. He leaned out\r\neagerly, tapping the rock with his feet, trying to\r\nget nearer to her as she flew across. But when\r\nshe was just opposite to him, she halted, her\r\nwings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak\r\nalmost within reach of his beak. He waited a\r\nmoment in surprise, wondering why she did not\r\ncome nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he\r\ndived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell\r\noutwards and downwards into space. Then a\r\nmonstrous terror seized him and his heart stood\r\nstill. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a\r\nminute. The next moment he felt his wings spread\r\noutwards. The wind rushed against his breast\r\nfeathers, then under his stomach, and against his\r\nwings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting\r\nthrough the air. He was not falling headlong now.\r\nHe was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.\r\nHe was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.\r\nThen he flapped his wings once and he soared\r\nupwards. \u201cGa, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,\u201d his\r\nmother swooped past him, her wings making a\r\nloud noise. He answered her with another scream.\r\nThen his father flew over him screaming. He saw\r\nhis two brothers and his sister flying around him\r\ncurveting and banking and soaring and diving.\r\nThen he completely forgot that he had not always\r\nbeen able to fly, and commended himself to dive\r\nand soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.\r\nHe was near the sea now, flying straight over\r\nit, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a\r\nvast green sea beneath him, with little ridges\r\nmoving over it and he turned his beak sideways\r\nand cawed amusedly.\r\nHis parents and his brothers and sister had\r\nlanded on this green flooring ahead of him. They\r\nwere beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped\r\nhis legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank\r\ninto it. He screamed with fright and attempted to\r\nrise again flapping his wings. But he was tired and\r\nweak with hunger and he could not rise, exhausted\r\nby the strange exercise. His feet sank into the green\r\nsea, and then his belly touched it and he sank no\r\nfarther. He was floating on it, and around him his\r\nfamily was screaming, praising him and their beaks\r\nwere offering him scraps of dog-fish.\r\nHe had made his first flight.\r\n\r\nThe Black Aeroplane\r\n\r\nTHE moon was coming up in the east, behind me,\r\nand stars were shining in the clear sky above me.\r\nThere wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky. I was happy to be\r\nalone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was\r\nflying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to\r\nEngland. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking\r\nforward to being with my family. I looked at my\r\nwatch: one thirty in the morning.\r\n\u2018I should call Paris Control soon,\u2019 I thought. As I\r\nlooked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw\r\nthe lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on\r\nthe radio and said, \u201cParis Control, Dakota DS 088\r\nhere. Can you hear me? I\u2019m on my way to England.\r\nOver.\u201d\r\nThe voice from the radio answered me immediately:\r\n\u201cDS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve\r\ndegrees west now, DS 088. Over.\u201d\r\nI checked the map and the compass, switched\r\nover to my second and last fuel tank, and turned\r\nthe Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.\r\n\u2018I\u2019ll be in time for breakfast,\u2019 I thought. A good\r\nbig English breakfast! Everything was going well \u2014\r\nit was an easy flight.\r\nParis was about 150 kilometres behind me when\r\nI saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.\r\nThey looked like black mountains standing in front\r\nof me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and\r\nover them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly\r\naround them to the north or south.\r\n\u201cI ought to go back to Paris,\u201d I thought, but I\r\nwanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.\r\n\u2018I\u2019ll take the risk,\u2019 I thought, and flew that old\r\nDakota straight into the storm.\r\nInside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\r\nIt was impossible to see anything outside the\r\naeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted\r\nin the air. I looked at the compass. I couldn\u2019t believe\r\nmy eyes: the compass was turning round and round\r\nand round. It was dead. It would not work! The\r\nother instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried\r\nthe radio.\r\n\u201cParis Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?\u201d\r\nThere was no answer. The radio was dead too. I\r\nhad no radio, no compass, and I could not see where\r\nI was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black\r\nclouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It\r\nhad no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying\r\nnext to me through the storm. I could see the pilot\u2019s\r\nface \u2014 turned towards me. I was very glad to see\r\nanother person. He lifted one hand and waved.\r\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d he was saying. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\r\n\u2018He knows that I am lost,\u2019 I thought. \u2018He\u2019s trying\r\nto help me.\u2019\r\nHe turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in\r\nfront of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for\r\nme to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the\r\nstrange aeroplane like an obedient child.\r\nAfter half an hour the strange black aeroplane\r\nwas still there in front of me in the clouds. Now\r\nthere was only enough fuel in the old Dakota\u2019s last\r\ntank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was\r\nstarting to feel frightened again. But then he started\r\nto go down and I followed through the storm.\r\nSuddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two\r\nlong straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a\r\nrunway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for\r\nmy friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was\r\nempty. There was nothing there. The black\r\naeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.\r\nI landed and was not sorry to walk away from the\r\nold Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked\r\na woman in the control centre where I was and who\r\nthe other pilot was. I wanted to say \u2018Thank you\u2019.\r\nShe looked at me very strangely, and then\r\nlaughed.\r\n\u201cAnother aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No\r\nother aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the\r\nonly one I could see on the radar.\u201d\r\nSo who helped me to arrive there safely without\r\na compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in\r\nmy tanks? Who was the pilot on the strange black\r\naeroplane, flying in the storm, without lights?;",

Certainly, all birds must be afraid to make their first flight.\nLikewise, a human baby is also afraid and finds it very challenging when it takes its first steps or when it\nlearns to crawl or walk on its own without any support.\n"

They let him stay on the ledge until he was ready to take the plunge.\nHe was left there for more than twenty-four hours and was very hungry by then. Due to this hunger, he was\nultimately compelled to fly. Furthermore, his hunger intensified when he saw his mother tearing at a piece of\nfish that was lying at her feet. He cried desperately, begging her to get some food for him. Seeing this, when\nhis mother came towards him with food in her beak, the little seagull screamed with joy and anticipation.\nHowever, she stopped midway, and the young seagull wondered why she did not come closer to him.\nMaddened by hunger, he dived at the food in his mother\u2019s beak. At that moment, he fell outwards and\ndownwards into the great expanse of sea beneath the cliff. He was terrified, and his heart stood still. But\nsoon enough, he felt his wings spread outwards, and he realized that he could fly like others. Therefore, his\nhunger overpowered his fear, and he finally made his first flight joyfully.\n"

And I\u2019m not. I have loving parents\r\nand a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about\r\nthirty people I can call friends. I have a family,\r\nloving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I\r\nseem to have everything, except my one true friend.\r\nAll I think about when I\u2019m with friends is having a\r\ngood time. I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about anything\r\nbut ordinary everyday things. We don\u2019t seem to be\r\nable to get any closer, and that\u2019s the problem. Maybe\r\nit\u2019s my fault that we don\u2019t confide in each other. In\r\nany case, that\u2019s just how things are, and\r\nunfortunately they\u2019re not liable to change. This is\r\nwhy I\u2019ve started the diary.\r\nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend\r\nin my imagination, I don\u2019t want to jot down the\r\nfacts in this diary the way most people would do,\r\nbut I want the diary to be my friend, and I\u2019m going\r\nto call this friend \u2018Kitty\u2019.\r\n\r\nSince no one would understand a word of my\r\nstories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I\u2019d better\r\nprovide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike\r\ndoing so.\r\nMy father, the most adorable father I\u2019ve ever seen,\r\ndidn\u2019t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and\r\nshe was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born\r\nin Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12\r\nJune 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My\r\nfather emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother,\r\nEdith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland\r\nin September, while Margot and I were sent to\r\nAachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went\r\nto Holland in December, and I followed in February,\r\nwhen I was plunked down on the table as a birthday\r\npresent for Margot.\r\nI started right away at the Montessori nursery\r\nschool. I stayed there until I was six, at which time\r\nI started in the first form. In the sixth form my\r\nteacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the\r\nend of the year we were both in tears as we said a\r\nheartbreaking farewell.\r\nIn the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had\r\nto have an operation, so my birthday passed with\r\nlittle celebration.\r\nGrandma died in January 1942. No one knows\r\nhow often I think of her and still love her. This\r\nbirthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make\r\nup for the other, and Grandma\u2019s candle was lit along\r\nwith the rest.\r\nThe four of us are still doing well, and that brings\r\nme to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the\r\nsolemn dedication of my diary.\r\n\r\nDearest Kitty,\r\nOur entire class is quaking in its boots. The\r\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\r\nwhich the teachers decide who\u2019ll move up to the\r\nnext form and who\u2019ll be kept back. Half the class is\r\nmaking bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the\r\ntwo boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have\r\nstaked their entire holiday savings on their bet.\r\nFrom morning to night, it\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re going to pass\u201d,\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u201d, \u201cYes, you are\u201d, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u201d. Even G.\u2019s\r\npleading glances and my angry outbursts can\u2019t calm\r\nthem down. If you ask me, there are so many\r\ndummies that about a quarter of the class should\r\nbe kept back, but teachers are the most\r\nunpredictable creatures on earth.\r\nI\u2019m not so worried about my girlfriends and\r\nmyself. We\u2019ll make it. The only subject I\u2019m not sure\r\nabout is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until\r\nthen, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\r\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There\r\nare nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr\r\nKeesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was\r\nannoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.\r\nAfter several warnings, he assigned me extra\r\nhomework. An essay on the subject, \u2018A Chatterbox\u2019.\r\nA chatterbox \u2014 what can you write about that? I\u2019d\r\nworry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the\r\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\r\nto keep quiet.\r\nThat evening, after I\u2019d finished the rest of my\r\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\r\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\r\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\r\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\r\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\r\nprove the necessity of talking. I thought and\r\nthought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the\r\nthree pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was\r\nsatisfied. I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait\r\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\r\nDearest Kitty,\r\nOur entire class is quaking in its boots.

An essay on the subject, \u2018A Chatterbox\u2019.\r\nA chatterbox \u2014 what can you write about that? I\u2019d\r\nworry about that later, I decided.

I argued that talking is a student\u2019s trait\r\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\r\nbut that I would never be able to cure myself of the\r\nhabit since my mother talked as much as I did if\r\nnot more, and that there\u2019s not much you can do\r\nabout inherited traits.\r\nMr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments,\r\nbut when I proceeded to talk my way through the\r\nnext lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This\r\ntime it was supposed to be on \u2018An Incorrigible\r\nChatterbox\u2019. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had\r\nnothing to complain about for two whole lessons.\r\nHowever, during the third lesson he\u2019d finally had\r\nenough. \u201cAnne Frank, as punishment for talking in\r\nclass, write an essay entitled \u2014 \u2018Quack, Quack,\r\nQuack, Said Mistress Chatterbox\u2019.\u201d\r\nThe class roared. I had to laugh too, though I\u2019d\r\nnearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of\r\nchatterboxes. It was time to come up with\r\nsomething else, something original. My friend,\r\nSanne, who\u2019s good at poetry, offered to help me write\r\nthe essay from beginning to end in verse and I\r\njumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a\r\njoke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I\u2019d make\r\nsure the joke was on him.\r\nI finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was\r\nabout a mother duck and a father swan with three\r\nbaby ducklings who were bitten to death by the\r\nfather because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr\r\nKeesing took the joke the right way. He read the\r\npoem to the class, adding his own comments, and\r\nto several other classes as well. Since then I\u2019ve been\r\nallowed to talk and haven\u2019t been assigned any extra\r\nhomework. On the contrary, Mr Keesing\u2019s always\r\nmaking jokes these days.\r\nYours,\r\nAnne",

        "content": "A Baker from Goa\r\nThis is a pen-portrait of a traditional Goan village baker who still\r\nhas an important place in his society.\r\nOUR elders are often heard reminiscing nostalgically\r\nabout those good old Portuguese days, the Portuguese\r\nand their famous loaves of bread. Those eaters of loaves\r\nmight have vanished but the makers are still there.\r\nWe still have amongst us the mixers, the moulders\r\nand those who bake the loaves. Those age-old, timetested\r\nfurnaces still exist. The fire in the furnaces\r\nhas not yet been extinguished. The thud and jingle of\r\nthe traditional baker\u2019s bamboo, heralding his arrival\r\nin the morning, can still be heard in some places.\r\nMaybe the father is not alive but the son still carries\r\non the family profession. These bakers are, even today,\r\nknown as pader in Goa.\r\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to\r\nbe our friend, companion and guide. He used to\r\ncome at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in\r\nthe morning on his selling round, and then again,\r\nwhen he returned after emptying his huge basket.\r\nThe jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from\r\nsleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was\r\nit so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The\r\nloaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine,\r\nthe maid-servant of the house! What we longed for\r\nwere those bread-bangles which we chose carefully.\r\nSometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\r\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene\r\nwith the \u2018jhang, jhang\u2019 sound of his specially made\r\nbamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on\r\nhis head and the other banged the bamboo on the\r\nground. He would greet the lady of the house with\r\n\u201cGood morning\u201d and then place his basket on the\r\nvertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside\r\nwith a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered\r\nto the servant. But we would not give up. We would\r\nclimb a bench or the parapet and peep into the\r\nbasket, somehow. I can still recall the typical\r\nfragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and\r\nthe bangles for the children. Then we did not even\r\ncare to brush our teeth or wash our mouths\r\nproperly. And why should we? Who would take the\r\ntrouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the\r\ntoothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The\r\ntiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash\r\nand clean up everything so nicely, after all!\r\nMarriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet\r\nbread known as the bol, just as a party or a feast\r\nloses its charm without bread. Not enough can be\r\nsaid to show how important a baker can be for a\r\nvillage. The lady of the house must prepare\r\nsandwiches on the occasion of her daughter\u2019s\r\nengagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for\r\nChristmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the\r\npresence of the baker\u2019s furnace in the village is\r\nabsolutely essential.\r\nThe baker or bread-seller of those days had a\r\npeculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a singlepiece\r\nlong frock reaching down to the knees. In our\r\nchildhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and\r\ntrousers which were shorter than full-length ones\r\nand longer than half pants. Even today, anyone\r\nwho wears a half pant which reaches just below\r\nthe knees invites the comment that he is dressed\r\nlike a pader!\r\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end\r\nof the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded\r\non some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a\r\nprofitable profession in the old days. The baker and\r\nhis family never starved. He, his family and his\r\nservants always looked happy and prosperous. Their\r\nplump physique was an open testimony to this. Even\r\ntoday any person with a jackfruit-like physical\r\nappearance is easily compared to a baker.\r\nCoorg\r\nCoorg is coffee country, famous for its rainforests and spices\r\nMIDWAY between Mysore and the coastal town of\r\nMangalore sits a piece of heaven that must have\r\ndrifted from the kingdom of god. This land of rolling\r\nhills is inhabited by a proud race of martial men,\r\nbeautiful women and wild creatures.\r\nCoorg, or Kodagu, the smallest district of\r\nKarnataka, is home to evergreen rainforests, spices\r\nand coffee plantations. Evergreen rainforests cover\r\nthirty per cent of this district. During the monsoons,\r\nit pours enough to keep many visitors away. The\r\nseason of joy commences from September and\r\ncontinues till March. The weather is perfect, with\r\nsome showers thrown in for\r\ngood measure. The air\r\nbreathes of invigorating\r\ncoffee. Coffee estates and\r\ncolonial bungalows stand\r\ntucked under tree canopies\r\nin prime corners.\r\nThe fiercely independent\r\npeople of Coorg are possibly\r\nof Greek or Arabic descent.\r\nAs one story goes, a part of\r\nAlexander\u2019s army moved\r\nsouth along the coast and\r\nsettled here when return\r\nbecame impractical. These\r\npeople married amongst the\r\nlocals and their culture is\r\napparent in the martial\r\ntraditions, marriage and\r\nreligious rites, which are\r\ndistinct from the Hindu\r\nmainstream. The theory of\r\nArab origin draws support\r\nfrom the long, black coat\r\nwith an embroidered waist-belt worn by the Kodavus.\r\nKnown as kuppia, it resembles the kuffia worn by\r\nthe Arabs and the Kurds.\r\nCoorgi homes have a tradition of hospitality, and\r\nthey are more than willing to recount numerous\r\ntales of valour related to their sons and fathers.\r\nThe Coorg Regiment is one of the most decorated in\r\nthe Indian Army, and the first Chief of the Indian\r\nArmy, General Cariappa, was a Coorgi. Even now,\r\nKodavus are the only people in India permitted to\r\ncarry firearms without a licence.\r\nThe river, Kaveri, obtains its water from the hills\r\nand forests of Coorg. Mahaseer \u2014 a large freshwater\r\nfish \u2014 abound in these waters. Kingfishers dive for\r\ntheir catch, while squirrels and langurs drop\r\npartially eaten fruit for the mischief of enjoying the\r\nsplash and the ripple effect in the clear water.\r\nElephants enjoy being bathed and scrubbed in the\r\nriver by their mahouts.\r\nThe most laidback individuals become converts\r\nto the life of high-energy adventure with river rafting,\r\ncanoeing, rappelling, rock climbing and mountain\r\nbiking. Numerous walking trails in this region are\r\na favourite with trekkers.\r\nBirds, bees and butterflies are there to give you\r\ncompany. Macaques, Malabar squirrels, langurs and\r\nslender loris keep a watchful eye from the tree canopy.\r\nI do, however, prefer to step aside for wild elephants.\r\nThe climb to the Brahmagiri hills brings you\r\ninto a panoramic view of the entire misty landscape\r\nof Coorg. A walk across the rope bridge leads to the\r\nsixty-four-acre island of Nisargadhama. Running\r\ninto Buddhist monks from India\u2019s largest Tibetan\r\nsettlement, at nearby Bylakuppe, is a bonus. The\r\nmonks, in red, ochre and yellow robes, are amongst\r\nthe many surprises that wait to be discovered by\r\nvisitors searching for the heart and soul of India,\r\nright here in Coorg.\r\nTea from Assam\r\nPranjol, a youngster from Assam, is Rajvir\u2019s classmate at school\r\nin Delhi. Pranjol\u2019s father is the manager of a tea-garden in Upper\r\nAssam and Pranjol has invited Rajvir to visit his home during the\r\nsummer vacation.\r\n\u201cCHAI-GARAM... garam-chai,\u201d a vendor called out in a\r\nhigh-pitched voice.\r\nHe came up to their window and asked,\u201dChai, sa\u2019ab?\u201d\r\n\u201cGive us two cups,\u201d Pranjol said.\r\nThey sipped the steaming hot liquid. Almost\r\neveryone in their compartment was drinking tea too.\r\n\u201cDo you know that over eighty crore cups of tea\r\nare drunk every day throughout the world?\u201d Rajvir said.\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d exclaimed Pranjol. \u201cTea really is very\r\npopular.\u201d\r\nThe train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried\r\nhis nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was\r\nan ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment\r\nhe was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery.\r\nIt was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never\r\nseen so much greenery before. Then the soft green\r\npaddy fields gave way to tea bushes.\r\nIt was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop\r\nof densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched\r\nas far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea\r\nplants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the\r\norderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures.\r\nIn the distance was an ugly building with smoke\r\nbillowing out of tall chimneys.\r\n\u201cHey, a tea garden!\u201d Rajvir cried excitedly.\r\nPranjol, who had been born and brought up on\r\na plantation, didn\u2019t share Rajvir\u2019s excitement.\r\n\u201cOh, this is tea country now,\u201d he said. \u201cAssam has\r\nthe largest concentration of plantations in the world.\r\nYou will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!\u201d\r\n\u201cI have been reading as much as I could about\r\ntea,\u201d Rajvir said. \u201cNo one really knows who\r\ndiscovered tea but there are many legends.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat legends?\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s the one about the Chinese emperor\r\nwho always boiled water before drinking it. One\r\nday a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot\r\nfell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is\r\nsaid they were tea leaves.\u201d\r\n\u201cTell me another!\u201d scoffed Pranjol.\r\n\u201cWe have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an\r\nancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because\r\nhe felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants\r\ngrew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants\r\nwhen put in hot water and drunk banished sleep.\r\n\u201cTea was first drunk in China,\u201d Rajvir added,\r\n\u201cas far back as 2700 B.C.! In fact words such as\r\ntea, \u2018chai\u2019 and \u2018chini\u2019 are from Chinese. Tea came to\r\nEurope only in the sixteenth century and was drunk\r\nmore as medicine than as beverage.\u201d\r\nThe train clattered into Mariani junction. The\r\nboys collected their luggage and pushed their way\r\nto the crowded platform.\r\nPranjol\u2019s parents were waiting for them.\r\nSoon they were driving towards Dhekiabari, the\r\ntea-garden managed by Pranjol\u2019s father.\r\nAn hour later the car veered sharply off the main\r\nroad. They crossed a cattle-bridge and entered\r\nDhekiabari Tea Estate.\r\nOn both sides of the gravel-road were acre upon\r\nacre of tea bushes, all neatly pruned to the same\r\nheight. Groups of tea-pluckers, with bamboo baskets\r\non their backs, wearing plastic aprons, were\r\nplucking the newly sprouted leaves.\r\nPranjol\u2019s father slowed down to allow a tractor,\r\npulling a trailer-load of tea leaves, to pass.\r\n\u201cThis is the second-flush or sprouting period,\r\nisn\u2019t it, Mr Barua?\u201d Rajvir asked. \u201cIt lasts from May\r\nto July and yields the best tea.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou seem to have done your homework before\r\ncoming,\u201d Pranjol\u2019s father said in surprise.\r\n\u201cYes, Mr Barua,\u201d Rajvir admitted. \u201cBut I hope to\r\nlearn much more while I\u2019m here.\u201d",

The large branches of the trees become cramped under the roof as they want to be set free\nso that they are able to spread themselves fully in the open air outside"

Towards the end of the stanza, she describes that the moon breaks into many pieces just like a\ncracked mirror and shines on the heads of the tallest oak trees.

                "answer": "The poem may connote different meanings to different readers. The poet tries to explain two different things\nusing the same metaphors in the poem.\n(i) Yes, the poem presents a conflict between man and nature. Humans have always had the tendency to\ndamage or harm nature without even realizing the usefulness and the benefits that mankind derives from it.\nThey do mass deforestation which disturbs the environmental balance and results in destruction of natural\nscenic beauty. Man tries to contain plants and trees within limited spaces that deny their natural freedom.\nDue to this reason, the branches of the trees want to spread themselves and feel the fresh air outside.\nSimilarly, in the poem \u2018A Tiger in the Zoo\u2019, the poet shows that animals which are kept in cages are unable\nto enjoy their freedom as even they want to be set free and run around freely in the open space.\n(ii) If trees have been used as a metaphor for human beings, then it could be said that just like trees,\nhumans would also like to break away from the shackles of their busy schedules and restricting boundaries\nthat life puts on them. Although men strive hard in their daily routines to earn a living, they don\u2019t always have\nthe privilege to enjoy its benefits. Modern life brings in a lot of physical comfort, but also has its equal share\nof drawbacks. Hence, even man wants to break free from all his tasks and enjoy the peaceful nature out in\nthe open just like the trees"

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "EARLY in the New Year of 1956 I travelled to Southern\r\nIraq. By then it had crossed my mind that I should\r\nlike to keep an otter instead of a dog, and that\r\nCamusfearna, ringed by water a stone\u2019s throw from\r\nits door, would be an eminently suitable spot for\r\nthis experiment.\r\nWhen I casually mentioned this to a friend, he\r\nas casually replied that I had better get one in the\r\nTigris marshes, for there they were as common as\r\nmosquitoes, and were often tamed by the Arabs.\r\nWe were going to Basra to the Consulate-General\r\nto collect and answer our mail from Europe. At the\r\nConsulate-General we found that my friend\u2019s mail\r\nhad arrived but that mine had not.\r\nI cabled to England, and when, three days later,\r\nnothing had happened, I tried to telephone. The call\r\nhad to be booked twenty-four hours in advance. On\r\nthe first day the line was out of order; on the second\r\nthe exchange was closed for a religious holiday. On\r\nthe third day there was another breakdown. My\r\nfriend left, and I arranged to meet him in a week\u2019s\r\ntime. Five days later, my mail arrived.\r\nI carried it to my bedroom to read, and there,\r\nsquatting on the floor, were two Arabs; beside them\r\nlay a sack that squirmed from time to time. They\r\nhanded me a note from my friend: \u201cHere is your otter...\u201d\r\nII\r\nWith the opening of that sack began a phase of my\r\nlife that has not yet ended, and may, for all I know,\r\nnot end before I do. It is, in effect, a thraldom to\r\notters, an otter fixation, that I have since found to\r\nbe shared by most other people, who have ever\r\nowned one.\r\nThe creature that emerged from this sack on to\r\nthe spacious tiled floor of the Consulate bedroom\r\nresembled most of all a very small, medievallyconceived,\r\ndragon. From the head to the tip of the tail he was coated with symmetrical pointed scales\r\nof mud armour, between whose tips was visible a\r\nsoft velvet fur like that of a chocolate-brown mole.\r\nHe shook himself, and I half expected a cloud of\r\ndust, but in fact it was not for another month that I\r\nmanaged to remove the last of the mud and see the\r\notter, as it were, in his true colours.\r\nMijbil, as I called the otter, was, in fact, of a\r\nrace previously unknown to science, and was at\r\nlength christened by zoologists Lutrogale perspicillata\r\nmaxwelli, or Maxwell\u2019s otter. For the first twentyfour\r\nhours Mijbil was neither hostile nor friendly;\r\nhe was simply aloof and indifferent, choosing to\r\nsleep on the floor as far from my bed as possible.\r\nThe second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the\r\nsmall hours and remained asleep in the crook of\r\nmy knees until the servant brought tea in the\r\nmorning, and during the day he began to lose his\r\napathy and take a keen, much too keen, interest in\r\nhis surroundings. I made a body-belt for him and\r\ntook him on a lead to the bathroom, where for half\r\nan hour he went wild with joy in the water, plunging\r\nand rolling in it, shooting up and down the length\r\nof the bathtub underwater, and making enough slosh\r\nand splash for a hippo. This, I was to learn, is a\r\ncharacteristic of otters; every drop of water must\r\nbe, so to speak, extended and spread about the\r\nplace; a bowl must at once be overturned, or, if it\r\nwill not be overturned, be sat in and sploshed in\r\nuntil it overflows. Water must be kept on the move\r\nand made to do things; when static it is wasted\r\nand provoking.\r\nTwo days later, Mijbil escaped from my bedroom\r\nas I entered it, and I turned to see his tail\r\ndisappearing round the bend of the corridor that\r\nled to the bathroom. By the time I got there he was\r\nup on the end of the bathtub and fumbling at the\r\nchromium taps with his paws. I watched, amazed;\r\nin less than a minute he had turned the tap far\r\nenough to produce a trickle of water, and after a\r\nmoment or two achieved the full flow. (He had been\r\nlucky to turn the tap the right way; on later\r\noccasions he would sometimes screw it up still\r\ntighter, chittering with irritation and disappointment\r\nat the tap\u2019s failure to cooperate.)\r\nVery soon Mij would follow me without a lead\r\nand come to me when I called his name. He spent\r\nmost of his time in play. He spent hours shuffling a\r\nrubber ball round the room like a four-footed soccer\r\nplayer using all four feet to dribble the ball, and he\r\ncould also throw it, with a powerful flick of the\r\nneck, to a surprising height and distance. But the\r\nreal play of an otter is when he lies on his back\r\nand juggles with small objects between his paws.\r\nMarbles were Mij\u2019s favourite toys for this pastime:\r\nhe would lie on his back rolling two or more of them\r\nup and down his wide, flat belly without ever\r\ndropping one to the floor.\r\nThe days passed peacefully at Basra, but I dreaded\r\nthe prospect of transporting Mij to England, and to\r\nCamusfearna. The British airline to London would\r\nnot fly animals, so I booked a flight to Paris on\r\nanother airline, and from there to London. The\r\nairline insisted that Mij should be packed into a\r\nbox not more than eighteen inches square, to be\r\ncarried on the floor at my feet. I had a box made,\r\nand an hour before we started, I put Mij into the\r\nbox so that he would become accustomed to it, and\r\nleft for a hurried meal.\r\nWhen I returned, there was an appalling\r\nspectacle. There was complete silence from the box,\r\nbut from its airholes and chinks around the lid,\r\nblood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock\r\nand tore open the lid, and Mij, exhausted and bloodspattered,\r\nwhimpered and caught at my leg. He had\r\ntorn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed\r\nthe last of it so that there were no cutting edges\r\nleft, it was just ten minutes until the time of the\r\nflight, and the airport was five miles distant. I put\r\nthe miserable Mij back into the box, holding down\r\nthe lid with my hand.\r\nI sat in the back of the car with the box beside\r\nme as the driver tore through the streets of Basra\r\nlike a ricochetting bullet. The aircraft was waiting\r\nto take off; I was rushed through to it by infuriated\r\nofficials. Luckily, the seat booked for me was at\r\nthe extreme front. I covered the floor around my\r\nfeet with newspapers, rang for the air hostess,\r\nand gave her a parcel of fish (for Mij) to keep in a\r\ncool place. I took her into my confidence about the\r\nevents of the last half hour. I have retained the\r\nmost profound admiration for that air hostess; she\r\nwas the very queen of her kind. She suggested\r\nthat I might prefer to have my pet on my knee, and\r\nI could have kissed her hand in the depth of my\r\ngratitude. But, not knowing otters, I was quite\r\nunprepared for what followed.\r\nMij was out of the box in a flash. He disappeared\r\nat high speed down the aircraft. There were squawks\r\nand shrieks, and a woman stood up on her seat\r\nscreaming out, \u201cA rat! A rat!\u201d I caught sight of Mij\u2019s\r\ntail disappearing beneath the legs of a portly whiteturbaned\r\nIndian. Diving for it, I missed, but found\r\nmy face covered in curry. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said the air\r\nhostess with the most charming smile, \u201cit would be\r\nbetter if you resumed your seat, and I will find the\r\nanimal and bring it to you.\u201d\r\nI returned to my seat. I was craning my neck\r\ntrying to follow the hunt when suddenly I heard\r\nfrom my feet a distressed chitter of recognition and\r\nwelcome, and Mij bounded on to my knee and began\r\nto nuzzle my face and my neck.\r\nAfter an eventful journey, Maxwell and his otter reach London, where\r\nhe has a flat.\r\nMij and I remained in London for nearly a month.\r\nHe would play for hours with a selection of toys,\r\nping-pong balls, marbles, rubber fruit, and a\r\nterrapin shell that I had brought back from his native\r\nmarshes. With the ping-pong ball he invented a\r\ngame of his own which could keep him engrossed\r\nfor up to half an hour at a time. A suitcase that I\r\nhad taken to Iraq had become damaged on the\r\njourney home, so that the lid, when closed,\r\nremained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij\r\ndiscovered that if he placed the ball on the high\r\nend it would run down the length of the suitcase.\r\nHe would dash around to the other end to ambush\r\nits arrival, hide from it, crouching, to spring up\r\nand take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it\r\nto the high end once more.\r\nOutside the house I exercised him on a lead,\r\nprecisely as if he had been a dog. Mij quickly developed\r\ncertain compulsive habits on these walks in the\r\nLondon streets, like the rituals of children who on\r\ntheir way to and from school must place their feet\r\nsquarely on the centre of each paving block; must\r\ntouch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or\r\npass to the outside of every second lamp post. Opposite\r\nto my flat was a single-storied primary school, along\r\nwhose frontage ran a low wall some two feet high. On\r\nhis way home, but never on his way out, Mij would\r\ntug me to this wall, jump on to it, and gallop the full\r\nlength of its thirty yards, to the hopeless distraction\r\nboth of pupils and of staff within.\r\nIt is not, I suppose, in any way strange that the\r\naverage Londoner should not recognise an otter, but\r\nthe variety of guesses as to what kind of animal this\r\nmight be came as a surprise to me. Otters belong to\r\na comparatively small group of animals called\r\nMustellines, shared by the badger, mongoose, weasel,\r\nstoat, mink and others. I faced a continuous barrage\r\nof conjectural questions that sprayed all the\r\nMustellines but the otter; more random guesses hit\r\non \u2018a baby seal\u2019 and \u2018a squirrel.\u2019 \u2018Is that a walrus,\r\nmister?\u2019 reduced me to giggles, and outside a dog\r\nshow I heard \u2018a hippo\u2019. A beaver, a bear cub, a leopard\r\n\u2014 one, apparently, that had changed its spots \u2014\r\nand a \u2018brontosaur\u2019; Mij was anything but an otter.\r\nBut the question for which I awarded the highest\r\nscore came from a labourer digging a hole in the street.\r\nI was still far from him when he laid down his tool,\r\nput his hands on his hips, and began to stare. As I\r\ndrew nearer I saw his expression of surprise and\r\naffront, as though he would have me know that he\r\nwas not one upon whom to play jokes. I came abreast\r\nof him; he spat, glared, and then growled out, \u201cHere,\r\nMister \u2014 what is that supposed to be?\u201d",

Another instance of his intelligence was when he opened the tap in the bathroom and got into the\ntub, and played with water. Although initially, he was aloof and indifferent towards Maxwell, he gradually\nexhibited his friendly nature towards his owner. This is evident from the fact that he clung to Maxwell\u2019s feet\nin the flight. He developed a close bond with the author in due course of time and proved to be a fun-loving\nanimal when he developed games on his own and exhibited certain compulsive habits on his walks with\nMaxwell in the streets of London"

        "title": "Madam Rides the Bus",
        "prologue": "",
        "content": "THERE was a girl named Valliammai who was called\r\nValli for short. She was eight years old and very\r\ncurious about things. Her favourite pastime was\r\nstanding in the front doorway of her house,\r\nwatching what was happening in the street outside.\r\nThere were no playmates of her own age on her\r\nstreet, and this was about all she had to do.\r\nBut for Valli, standing at the front door was every\r\nbit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other\r\nchildren played. Watching the street gave her many\r\nnew unusual experiences.\r\nThe most fascinating thing of all was the bus\r\nthat travelled between her village and the nearest\r\ntown. It passed through her street each hour, once\r\ngoing to the town and once coming back. The sight\r\nof the bus, filled each time with a new set of\r\npassengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\r\nDay after day she watched the bus, and\r\ngradually a tiny wish crept into her head and\r\ngrew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even\r\nif just once. This wish became stronger and\r\nstronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.\r\nValli would stare wistfully at the people who got\r\non or off the bus when it stopped at the street\r\ncorner. Their faces would kindle in her longings,\r\ndreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened\r\nto ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of\r\nthe town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen\r\nand would shout, in English: \u201cProud! proud!\u201d\r\nNeither she nor her friends really understood the\r\nmeaning of the word, but they used it often as a\r\nslang expression of disapproval.\r\nOver many days and months Valli listened\r\ncarefully to conversations between her neighbours\r\nand people who regularly used the bus, and she also\r\nasked a few discreet questions here and there. This\r\nway she picked up various small details about the\r\nbus journey. The town was six miles from her village.\r\nThe fare was thirty paise one way \u2014 \u201cwhich is almost\r\nnothing at all,\u201d she heard one well-dressed man say,\r\nbut to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money\r\nfrom one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The\r\ntrip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching\r\ntown, if she stayed in her seat and paid another\r\nthirty paise, she could return home on the same\r\nbus. This meant that she could take the one-o\u2019clock\r\nafternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and\r\nbe back home by about two forty-five...\r\nOn and on went her thoughts as she calculated\r\nand recalculated, planned and replanned.\r\nWell, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was\r\njust on the point of leaving the village and turning\r\ninto the main highway when a small voice was heard\r\nshouting: \u201cStop the bus! Stop the bus!\u201d And a tiny\r\nhand was raised commandingly.\r\nThe bus slowed down to a crawl, and the\r\nconductor, sticking his head out the door, said,\r\n\u201cHurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d shouted Valli. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has to\r\nget on.\u201d\r\nBy now the bus had come to a stop, and the\r\nconductor said, \u201cOh, really! You don\u2019t say so!\u201d\r\n\u201cYes, I simply have to go to town,\u201d said Valli,\r\nstill standing outside the bus, \u201cand here\u2019s my\r\nmoney.\u201d She showed him some coins.\r\n\u201cOkay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,\u201d\r\nsaid the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to\r\nhelp her up.\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, \u201cI can get on by myself.\r\nYou don\u2019t have to help me.\u201d\r\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. \u201cOh,\r\nplease don\u2019t be angry with me, my fine madam,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cHere, have a seat right up there in front.\r\nEverybody move aside please \u2014 make way for madam.\u201d\r\nIt was the slack time of day, and there were\r\nonly six or seven passengers on the bus. They were\r\nall looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor.\r\nValli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding\r\neveryone\u2019s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty\r\nseat and sat down.\r\n\u201cMay we start now, madam?\u201d the conductor\r\nasked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and\r\nthe bus moved forward with a roar.\r\nIt was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming\r\nwhite with some green stripes along the sides.\r\nInside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly\r\nin front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a\r\nbeautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.\r\nValli devoured everything with her eyes. But\r\nwhen she started to look outside, she found her\r\nview cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower\r\npart of her window. So she stood up on the seat\r\nand peered over the blind.\r\nThe bus was now going along the bank of a canal.\r\nThe road was very narrow. On one side there was\r\nthe canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland,\r\ndistant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the\r\nother side was a deep ditch and then acres and\r\nacres of green fields \u2014 green, green, green, as far\r\nas the eye could see.\r\nOh, it was all so wonderful!\r\nSuddenly she was startled by a voice. \u201cListen,\r\nchild,\u201d said the voice, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t stand like that.\r\nSit down.\u201dSitting down, she looked to see who had spoken.\r\nIt was an elderly man who had honestly been\r\nconcerned for her, but she was annoyed by\r\nhis attention.\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here who\u2019s a child,\u201d she said\r\nhaughtily. \u201cI\u2019ve paid my thirty paise like everyone\r\nelse.\u201d\r\nThe conductor chimed in. \u201cOh, sir, but this is a\r\nvery grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl\r\ncould pay her own fare and travel to the city\r\nall alone?\u201d\r\nValli shot an angry glance at the conductor and\r\nsaid, \u201cI am not a madam. Please remember that.\r\nAnd you\u2019ve not yet given me my ticket.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d the conductor said, mimicking\r\nher tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too\r\njoined in the laughter.\r\nThe conductor punched a ticket and handed it\r\nto her. \u201cJust sit back and make yourself comfortable.\r\nWhy should you stand when you\u2019ve paid for a seat?\u201d\r\n\u201cBecause I want to,\u201d she answered, standing\r\nup again.\r\n\u201cBut if you stand on the seat, you may fall and\r\nhurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn\r\nor hits a bump. That\u2019s why we want you to sit\r\ndown, child.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a child, I tell you,\u201d she said irritably.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m eight years old.\u201d\r\n\u201cOf course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight\r\nyears \u2014 my!\u201d\r\nThe bus stopped, some new passengers got on,\r\nand the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of\r\nlosing her seat, Valli finally sat down.\r\nAn elderly woman came and sat beside her. \u201cAre\r\nyou all alone, dear?\u201d she asked Valli as the bus\r\nstarted again.\r\nValli found the woman absolutely repulsive \u2014 such\r\nbig holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly\r\nearrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut\r\nthe woman was chewing and see the betel juice that\r\nwas threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.\r\nUgh! \u2014 who could be sociable with such a person?\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m travelling alone,\u201d she answered curtly.\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a ticket too.\u201d\r\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s on her way to town,\u201d said the\r\nconductor. \u201cWith a thirty-paise ticket.\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, why don\u2019t you mind your own business,\u201d\r\nsaid Valli. But she laughed all the same, and the\r\nconductor laughed too.\r\nBut the old woman went on with her drivel. \u201cIs\r\nit proper for such a young person to travel alone?\r\nDo you know exactly where you\u2019re going in town?\r\nWhat\u2019s the street? What\u2019s the house number?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t bother about me. I can take care of\r\nmyself,\u201d Valli said, turning her face towards the\r\nwindow and staring out\r\nUgh! \u2014 who could be sociable with such a person?\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m travelling alone,\u201d she answered curtly.\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a ticket too.\u201d\r\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s on her way to town,\u201d said the\r\nconductor. \u201cWith a thirty-paise ticket.\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, why don\u2019t you mind your own business,\u201d\r\nsaid Valli. But she laughed all the same, and the\r\nconductor laughed too.\r\nBut the old woman went on with her drivel. \u201cIs\r\nit proper for such a young person to travel alone?\r\nDo you know exactly where you\u2019re going in town?\r\nWhat\u2019s the street? What\u2019s the house number?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t bother about me. I can take care of\r\nmyself,\u201d Valli said, turning her face towards the\r\nwindow and staring out. Her first journey \u2014 what careful, painstaking,\r\nelaborate plans she had had to make for it! She had\r\nthriftily saved whatever stray coins came her way,\r\nresisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys,\r\nballoons, and the like, and finally she had saved a\r\ntotal of sixty paise. How difficult it had been,\r\nparticularly that day at the village fair, but she had\r\nresolutely stifled a strong desire to ride the merrygo-\r\nround, even though she had the money.\r\nAfter she had enough money saved, her next\r\nproblem was how to slip out of the house without\r\nher mother\u2019s knowledge. But she managed this\r\nwithout too much difficulty. Every day after lunch\r\nher mother would nap from about one to four or so.\r\nValli always used these hours for her \u2018excursions\u2019\r\nas she stood looking from the doorway of her house.\r\nor sometimes even ventured out into the village;\r\ntoday, these same hours could be used for her first\r\nexcursion outside the village.\r\nThe bus rolled on now cutting across a bare\r\nlandscape, now rushing through a tiny hamlet or\r\npast an odd wayside shop. Sometimes the bus\r\nseemed on the point of gobbling up another vehicle\r\nthat was coming towards them or a pedestrian\r\ncrossing the road. But lo! somehow it passed on\r\nsmoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees\r\ncame running towards them but then stopped as\r\nthe bus reached them and simply stood there\r\nhelpless for a moment by the side of the road before\r\nrushing away in the other direction.\r\nSuddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A\r\nyoung cow, tail high in the air, was running very\r\nfast, right in the middle of the road, right in front\r\nof the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver\r\nsounded his horn loudly again and again. But the\r\nmore he honked, the more frightened the animal\r\nbecame and the faster it galloped \u2014 always right in\r\nfront of the bus.\r\nSomehow this was very funny to Valli. She laughed\r\nand laughed until there were tears in her eyes.\r\n\u201cHey, lady, haven\u2019t you laughed enough?\u201d called,\r\nthe conductor. \u201cBetter save some for tomorrow.\u201d\r\nAt last the cow moved off the road. And soon the\r\nbus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train\r\ncould be seen in the distance, growing bigger and\r\nbigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the\r\ncrossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle,\r\nshaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed\r\nthe train station. From there it traversed a busy,\r\nwell-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered\r\na wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking\r\nshops! What glittering displays of clothes and other\r\nmerchandise! Such big crowds!\r\nStruck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.\r\nThen the bus stopped and everyone got off\r\nexcept Valli.\r\n\u201cHey, lady,\u201d said the conductor, \u201caren\u2019t you ready\r\nto get off? This is as far as your thirty paise\r\ntakes you.\u201d\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Valli said, \u201cI\u2019m going back on this same\r\nbus.\u201d She took another thirty paise from her pocket\r\nand handed the coins to the conductor.\r\n\u201cWhy, is something the matter?\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s the matter. I just felt like having\r\na bus ride, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to have a look at the sights,\r\nnow that you\u2019re here?\u201d\r\n\u201cAll by myself? Oh, I\u2019d be much too afraid.\u201d\r\nGreatly amused by the girl\u2019s way of speaking,\r\nthe conductor said, \u201cBut you weren\u2019t afraid to come\r\nin the bus.\u201d\r\n\u201cNothing to be afraid of about that,\u201d she\r\nanswered.\r\n\u201cWell, then, why not go to that stall over there\r\nand have something to drink? Nothing to be afraid\r\nof about that either.\"\r\n\u201cOh, no, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, then, let me bring you a cold drink.\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have enough money. Just give me\r\nmy ticket, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be my treat and not cost you anything.\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cplease, no.\u201d\r\nThe conductor shrugged, and they waited until\r\nit was time for the bus to begin the return journey.\r\nAgain there weren\u2019t many passengers.\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t your mother be looking for you?\u201d the\r\nconductor asked when he gave the girl her ticket.\r\n\u201cNo, no one will be looking for me,\u201d she said.\r\nThe bus started, and again there were the same\r\nwonderful sights.\r\nValli wasn\u2019t bored in the slightest and greeted\r\neverything with the same excitement she\u2019d felt the\r\nfirst time. But suddenly she saw a young cow lying\r\ndead by the roadside, just where it had been struck\r\nby some fast-moving vehicle.\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same cow that ran in front of the\r\nbus on our trip to town?\u201d she asked the conductor.\r\nThe conductor nodded, and she was overcome\r\nwith sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful\r\ncreature just a little while ago had now suddenly\r\nlost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so\r\nfrightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed\r\nstare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...\r\nThe bus moved on. The memory of the dead cow\r\nhaunted her, dampening her enthusiasm. She no\r\nlonger wanted to look out the window.\r\nShe sat thus, glued to her seat, until the bus\r\nreached her village at three forty. She stood up and\r\nstretched herself. Then she turned to the conductor\r\nand said, \u201cWell, sir, 1 hope to see you again.\u201d\r\n\u201cOkay, madam,\u201d he answered her, smiling.\r\n\u201cWhenever you feel like a bus ride, come and join\r\nus. And don\u2019t forget to bring your fare.\u201d\r\nShe laughed and jumped down from the bus.\r\nThen away she went, running straight for home.\r\nWhen she entered her house she found her\r\nmother awake and talking to one of Valli\u2019s aunts,\r\nthe one from South Street. This aunt was a real\r\nchatterbox, never closing her mouth once she\r\nstarted talking.\r\n\u201cAnd where have you been?\u201d said her aunt when\r\nValli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting\r\na reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and\r\naunt went on with their conversation.\r\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d her mother said. \u201cSo many\r\nthings in our midst and in the world outside. How\r\ncan we possibly know about everything? And even\r\nwhen we do know about something, we often can\u2019t\r\nunderstand it completely, can we?\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d breathed Valli.\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked her mother. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Valli, \u201cI was just agreeing with what\r\nyou said about things happening without our\r\nknowledge.\u201d\r\n\u201cJust a chit of a girl, she is,\u201d said her aunt, \u201cand\r\nyet look how she pokes her nose into our conversation,\r\njust as though she were a grown lady.\u201d\r\nValli smiled to herself. She didn\u2019t want them to\r\nunderstand her smile. But, then, there wasn\u2019t much\r\nchance of that, was there?",

The poem was composed with a fixed rhyme scheme that makes it interesting and\nenjoyable to read. The poet has also used the wrong spelling, \u2018winda\u2019 instead of \u2018window\u2019, to maintain the\nrhyme scheme with \u2018Belinda\u2019 in the seventh stanza. The poet also describes the features of Belinda and her\npets in a humorous manner. He compared Belinda\u2019s bravery to a barrel full of bears, her kitten, Ink and\nmouse, Blink to be so brave that they could scare a lion down the stairs and her dog, Mustard, was brave\nlike a raging tiger. On the contrary, her dragon Custard is the only one who has been projected to be a\ncoward who looks for a cage for itself and was made fun of often by others for its cowardice. However, when\nthe pirate attacked the little house, and everyone was scared, it was the same \u2018cowardly\u2019 dragon who saved\neveryone and jumped snorting like an engine on the pirate. It clashed its tail and charged towards the pirate\nlike a robin at a worm and ate him. Although everyone made fun of the little dragon, it proved to be the\nbravest of all. Hence, the poem is dramatically ironic, which is funny and reflects the fun and humorous side\nof the poet."

At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in\r\nthe Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he\r\nreturned home to marry a princess. They had a son\r\nand lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about\r\nthe age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded\r\nfrom the sufferings of the world, while out hunting\r\nchanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then\r\na funeral procession, and finally a monk begging\r\nfor alms. These sights so moved him that he at\r\nonce went out into the world to seek enlightenment\r\nconcerning the sorrows he had witnessed.\r\nHe wandered for seven years and finally sat\r\ndown under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay\r\nuntil enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven\r\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\r\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\r\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\r\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\r\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\r\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\r\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\r\nhere. It reflects the Buddha\u2019s wisdom about one\r\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\r\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\r\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\r\nthem for medicine, and the people said, \u201cShe has lost\r\nher senses. The boy is dead.\u201d\r\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\r\nrequest, \u201cI cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\r\nknow a physician who can.\u201d\r\nAnd the girl said, \u201cPray tell me, sir; who is it?\u201d And\r\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.\u201d\r\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, \u201cLord\r\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.\u201d\r\nThe Buddha answered, \u201cI want a handful of mustardseed.\u201d\r\nAnd when the girl in her joy promised to procure\r\nit, the Buddha added, \u201cThe mustard-seed must be taken\r\nfrom a house where no one has lost a child, husband,\r\nparent or friend.\u201d\r\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\r\nand the people pitied her and said, \u201cHere is mustardseed;\r\ntake it!\u201d But when she asked, \u201cDid a son or\r\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?\u201d they\r\nanswered her, \u201cAlas! the living are few, but the dead are\r\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.\u201d And there\r\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\r\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\r\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\r\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\r\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\r\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\r\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\r\n\u201cHow selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\r\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\r\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.\u201d\r\nThe Buddha said, \u2018\u2018The life of mortals in this world\r\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain. For there\r\nis not any means by which those that have been born\r\ncan avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of\r\nsuch a nature are living beings. As ripe fruits are early\r\nin danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in\r\ndanger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the\r\npotter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both\r\nyoung and adult, both those who are fools and those\r\nwho are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are\r\nsubject to death.\r\n\u201cOf those who, overcome by death, depart from life,\r\na father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations.\r\nMark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting\r\ndeeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox\r\nthat is led to the slaughter. So the world is afflicted with\r\ndeath and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve,\r\nknowing the terms of the world.\r\n\u201cNot from weeping nor from grieving will anyone\r\nobtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be\r\nthe greater and his body will suffer. He will make himself\r\nsick and pale, yet the dead are not saved by his\r\nlamentation. He who seeks peace should draw out the\r\narrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who\r\nhas drawn out the arrow and has become composed\r\nwill obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all\r\nsorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed.\u201d",

He gave her\nthe ultimate lesson of life that humans are mortal beings, and it is natural for everyone to die.

CHUBUKOV rises to meet him.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my darling ... How are you?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Thank you. And how may you be getting on?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and so on. Sit down, please do. ... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going anywhere, my treasure?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're paying a New Year's Eve visit!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and you have always, so to speak ... I must ask your pardon, I am getting excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch. [Drinks.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any! [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: You see, Honour Stepanitch ... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch ... I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice. ... In short, you alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course ... and haven't any right to count on your assistance. ...\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: One moment ... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn't hear it all!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I have the honour to ask ...\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Interrupting] My dear fellow ... I'm so glad, and so on. ... Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV] I've been hoping for it for a long time. It's been my continual desire. [Sheds a tear] And I've always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I did so much hope ... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I'm off my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul ... I'll go and call Natasha, and all that.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: [Greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count on her consent?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Why, of course, my darling, and ... as if she won't consent! She's in love; egad, she's like a love-sick cat, and so on. ... Shan't be long! [Exit.]\r\n\r\nLOMOV: It's cold ... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married. ... Brr! ... It's cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated. ... What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in my ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it's impossible for me not to marry. ... In the first place, I'm already 35--a critical age, so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life. ... I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully upset. ... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a twitch in my right eyebrow. ... But the very worst of all is the way I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly something in my left side gives a pull, and I can feel it in my shoulder and head. ... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's another pull! And this may happen twenty times. ...\r\n\r\n[NATALYA STEPANOVNA comes in.]\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Well, there! It's you, and papa said, \"Go; there's a merchant come for his goods.\" How do you do, Ivan Vassilevitch!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: You must excuse my apron and n\u00e9lig\u00e9 ... we're shelling peas for drying. Why haven't you been here for such a long time? Sit down. [They seat themselves] Won't you have some lunch?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: No, thank you, I've had some already.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Then smoke. ... Here are the matches. ... The weather is splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen didn't do anything all day. How much hay have you stacked? Just think, I felt greedy and had a whole field cut, and now I'm not at all pleased about it because I'm afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But what's this? Why, you're in evening dress! Well, I never! Are you going to a ball, or what?--though I must say you look better. Tell me, why are you got up like that?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: [Excited] You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna ... the fact is, I've made up my mind to ask you to hear me out. ... Of course you'll be surprised and perhaps even angry, but a ... [Aside] It's awfully cold!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What's the matter? [Pause] Well?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I shall try to be brief. You must know, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, that I have long, since my childhood, in fact, had the privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt and her husband, from whom, as you know, I inherited my land, always had the greatest respect for your father and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most affectionate, regard for each other. And, as you know, my land is a near neighbour of yours. You will remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your birchwoods.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Excuse my interrupting you. You say, \"my Oxen Meadows. ...\" But are they yours?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Yes, mine.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What are you talking about? Oxen Meadows are ours, not yours!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: No, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that out?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: How? I'm speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are wedged in between your birchwoods and the Burnt Marsh.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Yes, yes. ... They're ours.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: No, you're mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, they're mine.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they been yours?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: How long? As long as I can remember.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Really, you won't get me to believe that!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: But you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya Stepanovna. Oxen Meadows, it's true, were once the subject of dispute, but now everybody knows that they are mine. There's nothing to argue about. You see, my aunt's grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows in perpetuity to the peasants of your father's grandfather, in return for which they were to make bricks for her. The peasants belonging to your father's grandfather had the free use of the Meadows for forty years, and had got into the habit of regarding them as their own, when it happened that ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: No, it isn't at all like that! Both my grandfather and great-grandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt Marsh--which means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I don't see what there is to argue about. It's simply silly!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I'll show you the documents, Natalya Stepanovna!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: No, you're simply joking, or making fun of me. ... What a surprise! We've had the land for nearly three hundred years, and then we're suddenly told that it isn't ours! Ivan Vassilevitch, I can hardly believe my own ears. ... These Meadows aren't worth much to me. They only come to five dessiatins [Note: 13.5 acres], and are worth perhaps 300 roubles [Note: \u00a330.], but I can't stand unfairness. Say what you will, but I can't stand unfairness.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Hear me out, I implore you! The peasants of your father's grandfather, as I have already had the honour of explaining to you, used to bake bricks for my aunt's grandmother. Now my aunt's grandmother, wishing to make them a pleasant ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I can't make head or tail of all this about aunts and grandfathers and grandmothers! The Meadows are ours, and that's all.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Mine\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Ours! You can go on proving it for two days on end, you can go and put on fifteen dress-jackets, but I tell you they're ours, ours, ours! I don't want anything of yours and I don't want to give up anything of mine. So there!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Natalya Ivanovna, I don't want the Meadows, but I am acting on principle. If you like, I'll make you a present of them.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I can make you a present of them myself, because they're mine! Your behaviour, Ivan Vassilevitch, is strange, to say the least! Up to this we have always thought of you as a good neighbour, a friend: last year we lent you our threshing-machine, although on that account we had to put off our own threshing till November, but you behave to us as if we were gipsies. Giving me my own land, indeed! No, really, that's not at all neighbourly! In my opinion, it's even impudent, if you want to know....\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Then you make out that I'm a land-grabber? Madam, never in my life have I grabbed anybody else's land, and I shan't allow anybody to accuse me of having done so. ... [Quickly steps to the carafe and drinks more water] Oxen Meadows are mine!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's not true, they're ours!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Mine!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's not true! I'll prove it! I'll send my mowers out to the Meadows this very day!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: What?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: My mowers will be there this very day!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I'll give it to them in the neck!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: You dare!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: [Clutches at his heart] Oxen Meadows are mine! You understand? Mine!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Please don't shout! You can shout yourself hoarse in your own house, but here I must ask you to restrain yourself!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: If it wasn't, madam, for this awful, excruciating palpitation, if my whole inside wasn't upset, I'd talk to you in a different way! [Yells] Oxen Meadows are mine!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Ours!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Mine!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Ours!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Mine!\r\n\r\n[Enter CHUBUKOV.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What's the matter? What are you shouting at?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Papa, please tell to this gentleman who owns Oxen Meadows, we or he?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [To LOMOV] Darling, the Meadows are ours!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: But, please, Stepan Stepanitch, how can they be yours? Do be a reasonable man! My aunt's grandmother gave the Meadows for the temporary and free use of your grandfather's peasants. The peasants used the land for forty years and got as accustomed to it as if it was their own, when it happened that ...\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Excuse me, my precious. ... You forget just this, that the peasants didn't pay your grandmother and all that, because the Meadows were in dispute, and so on. And now everybody knows that they're ours. It means that you haven't seen the plan.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I'll prove to you that they're mine!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: You won't prove it, my darling.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I shall!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Dear one, why yell like that? You won't prove anything just by yelling. I don't want anything of yours, and don't intend to give up what I have. Why should I? And you know, my beloved, that if you propose to go on arguing about it, I'd much sooner give up the meadows to the peasants than to you. There!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I don't understand! How have you the right to give away somebody else's property?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: You may take it that I know whether I have the right or not. Because, young man, I'm not used to being spoken to in that tone of voice, and so on: I, young man, am twice your age, and ask you to speak to me without agitating yourself, and all that.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: No, you just think I'm a fool and want to have me on! You call my land yours, and then you want me to talk to you calmly and politely! Good neighbours don't behave like that, Stepan Stepanitch! You're not a neighbour, you're a grabber!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What's that? What did you say?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Papa, send the mowers out to the Meadows at once!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What did you say, sir?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Oxen Meadows are ours, and I shan't give them up, shan't give them up, shan't give them up!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: We'll see! I'll have the matter taken to court, and then I'll show you!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: To court? You can take it to court, and all that! You can! I know you; you're just on the look-out for a chance to go to court, and all that. ... You pettifogger! All your people were like that! All of them!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Never mind about my people! The Lomovs have all been honourable people, and not one has ever been tried for embezzlement, like your grandfather!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: You Lomovs have had lunacy in your family, all of you!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: All, all, all!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Your grandfather was a drunkard, and your younger aunt, Nastasya Mihailovna, ran away with an architect, and so on.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: And your mother was hump-backed. [Clutches at his heart] Something pulling in my side. ... My head. ... Help! Water!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Your father was a guzzling gambler!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: And there haven't been many backbiters to equal your aunt!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: My left foot has gone to sleep. ... You're an intriguer. ... Oh, my heart! ... And it's an open secret that before the last elections you bri ... I can see stars. ... Where's my hat?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's low! It's dishonest! It's mean!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: And you're just a malicious, double-faced intriguer! Yes!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Here's my hat. ... My heart! ... Which way? Where's the door? Oh! ... I think I'm dying. ... My foot's quite numb. ...\r\n\r\n[Goes to the door.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Following him] And don't set foot in my house again!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Take it to court! We'll see!\r\n\r\n[LOMOV staggers out.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Devil take him! [Walks about in excitement.]\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What a rascal! What trust can one have in one's neighbours after that!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: The villain! The scarecrow!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: The monster! First he takes our land and then he has the impudence to abuse us.\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: And that blind hen, yes, that turnip-ghost has the confounded cheek to make a proposal, and so on! What? A proposal!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What proposal?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Why, he came here so as to propose to you.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: To propose? To me? Why didn't you tell me so before?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: So he dresses up in evening clothes. The stuffed sausage! The wizen-faced frump!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: To propose to me? Ah! [Falls into an easy-chair and wails] Bring him back! Back! Ah! Bring him here.\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Bring whom here?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Quick, quick! I'm ill! Fetch him! [Hysterics.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What's that? What's the matter with you? [Clutches at his head] Oh, unhappy man that I am! I'll shoot myself! I'll hang myself! We've done for her!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I'm dying! Fetch him!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Tfoo! At once. Don't yell!\r\n\r\n[Runs out. A pause. NATALYA STEPANOVNA wails.]\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA. What have they done to me! Fetch him back! Fetch him! [A pause.]\r\n\r\n[CHUBUKOV runs in.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: He's coming, and so on, devil take him! Ouf! Talk to him yourself; I don't want to. ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: [Wails] Fetch him!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Yells] He's coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to be the father of a grown-up daughter! I'll cut my throat! I will, indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out, and it's all you ... you!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: No, it was you!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: I tell you it's not my fault. [LOMOV appears at the door] Now you talk to him yourself [Exit.]\r\n\r\n[LOMOV enters, exhausted.]\r\n\r\nLOMOV: My heart's palpitating awfully. ... My foot's gone to sleep. ... There's something keeps pulling in my side.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Forgive us, Ivan Vassilevitch, we were all a little heated. ... I remember now: Oxen Meadows really are yours.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: My heart's beating awfully. ... My Meadows. ... My eyebrows are both twitching. ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: The Meadows are yours, yes, yours. ... Do sit down. ... [They sit] We were wrong. ...\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I did it on principle. ... My land is worth little to me, but the principle ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Yes, the principle, just so. ... Now let's talk of something else.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: The more so as I have evidence. My aunt's grandmother gave the land to your father's grandfather's peasants ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Yes, yes, let that pass. ... [Aside] I wish I knew how to get him started. ... [Aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I'm thinking of having a go at the blackcock, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a misfortune I've had! My dog Guess, whom you know, has gone lame.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What a pity! Why?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I don't know. ... Must have got twisted, or bitten by some other dog. ... [Sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I think it was very cheap. He's a first-rate dog.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer is heaps better than Guess!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Squeezer better than. Guess? What an idea! [Laughs] Squeezer better than Guess!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Of course he's better! Of course, Squeezer is young, he may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he's better than anything that even Volchanetsky has got.\r\n\r\nLOMOV. Excuse me, Natalya Stepanovna, but you forget that he is overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is a bad hunter!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Overshot, is he? The first time I hear it!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Have you measured?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Yes. He's all right at following, of course, but if you want him to get hold of anything ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred animal, the son of Harness and Chisels, while there's no getting at the pedigree of your dog at all. ... He's old and as ugly as a worn-out cab-horse.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: He is old, but I wouldn't take five Squeezers for him. ... Why, how can you? ... Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well, it's too funny to argue. ... Anybody you like has a dog as good as Squeezer ... you may find them under every bush almost. Twenty-five roubles would be a handsome price to pay for him.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: There's some demon of contradiction in you today, Ivan Vassilevitch. First you pretend that the Meadows are yours; now, that Guess is better than Squeezer. I don't like people who don't say what they mean, because you know perfectly well that Squeezer is a hundred times better than your silly Guess. Why do you want to say it isn't?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I see, Natalya Stepanovna, that you consider me either blind or a fool. You must realize that Squeezer is overshot!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's not true.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: He is!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's not true!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Why shout, madam?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Why talk rot? It's awful! It's time your Guess was shot, and you compare him with Squeezer!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Excuse me; I cannot continue this discussion: my heart is palpitating.\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I've noticed that those hunters argue most who know least.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Madam, please be silent. ... My heart is going to pieces. ... [Shouts] Shut up!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I shan't shut up until you acknowledge that Squeezer is a hundred times better than your Guess!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: A hundred times worse! Be hanged to your Squeezer! His head ... eyes ... shoulder ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: There's no need to hang your silly Guess; he's half-dead already!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: [Weeps] Shut up! My heart's bursting!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I shan't shut up.\r\n\r\n[Enter CHUBUKOV.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What's the matter now?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Papa, tell us truly, which is the better dog, our Squeezer or his Guess.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Stepan Stepanovitch, I implore you to tell me just one thing: is your Squeezer overshot or not? Yes or no?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: And suppose he is? What does it matter? He's the best dog in the district for all that, and so on.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: But isn't my Guess better? Really, now?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Don't excite yourself, my precious one. ... Allow me. ... Your Guess certainly has his good points. ... He's pure-bred, firm on his feet, has well-sprung ribs, and all that. But, my dear man, if you want to know the truth, that dog has two defects: he's old and he's short in the muzzle.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Excuse me, my heart. ... Let's take the facts. ... You will remember that on the Marusinsky hunt my Guess ran neck-and-neck with the Count's dog, while your Squeezer was left a whole verst behind.\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: He got left behind because the Count's whipper-in hit him with his whip.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: And with good reason. The dogs are running after a fox, when Squeezer goes and starts worrying a sheep!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: It's not true! ... My dear fellow, I'm very liable to lose my temper, and so, just because of that, let's stop arguing. You started because everybody is always jealous of everybody else's dogs. Yes, we're all like that! You too, sir, aren't blameless! You no sooner notice that some dog is better than your Guess than you begin with this, that ... and the other ... and all that. ... I remember everything!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I remember too!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Teasing him] I remember, too. ... What do you remember?\r\n\r\nLOMOV: My heart ... my foot's gone to sleep. ... I can't ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: [Teasing] My heart. ... What sort of a hunter are you? You ought to go and lie on the kitchen oven and catch blackbeetles, not go after foxes! My heart!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Yes really, what sort of a hunter are you, anyway? You ought to sit at home with your palpitations, and not go tracking animals. You could go hunting, but you only go to argue with people and interfere with their dogs and so on. Let's change the subject in case I lose my temper. You're not a hunter at all, anyway!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: And are you a hunter? You only go hunting to get in with the Count and to intrigue. ... Oh, my heart! ... You're an intriguer!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What? I an intriguer? [Shouts] Shut up!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Intriguer!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Boy! Pup!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Old rat! Jesuit!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Shut up or I'll shoot you like a partridge! You fool!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Everybody knows that--oh my heart!--your late wife used to beat you. ... My feet ... temples ... sparks. ... I fall, I fall!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: And you're under the slipper of your housekeeper!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: There, there, there ... my heart's burst! My shoulder's come off. ... Where is my shoulder? I die. [Falls into an armchair] A doctor! [Faints.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Boy! Milksop! Fool! I'm sick! [Drinks water] Sick!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: What sort of a hunter are you? You can't even sit on a horse! [To her father] Papa, what's the matter with him? Papa! Look, papa! [Screams] Ivan Vassilevitch! He's dead!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: I'm sick! ... I can't breathe! ... Air!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: He's dead. [Pulls LOMOV'S sleeve] Ivan Vassilevitch! Ivan Vassilevitch! What have you done to me? He's dead. [Falls into an armchair] A doctor, a doctor! [Hysterics.]\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Oh! ... What is it? What's the matter?\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: [Wails] He's dead ... dead!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Who's dead? [Looks at LOMOV] So he is! My word! Water! A doctor! [Lifts a tumbler to LOMOV'S mouth] Drink this! ... No, he doesn't drink. ... It means he's dead, and all that. ... I'm the most unhappy of men! Why don't I put a bullet into my brain? Why haven't I cut my throat yet? What am I waiting for? Give me a knife! Give me a pistol! [LOMOV moves] He seems to be coming round. ... Drink some water! That's right. ...\r\n\r\nLOMOV: I see stars ... mist. ... Where am I?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Hurry up and get married and--well, to the devil with you! She's willing! [He puts LOMOV'S hand into his daughter's] She's willing and all that. I give you my blessing and so on. Only leave me in peace!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: [Getting up] Eh? What? To whom?\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: She's willing! Well? Kiss and be damned to you!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: [Wails] He's alive. . . Yes, yes, I'm willing. ...\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Kiss each other!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Eh? Kiss whom? [They kiss] Very nice, too. Excuse me, what's it all about? Oh, now I understand ... my heart ... stars ... I'm happy. Natalya Stepanovna. ... [Kisses her hand] My foot's gone to sleep. ...\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: I ... I'm happy too. ...\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: What a weight off my shoulders. ... Ouf!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: But ... still you will admit now that Guess is worse than Squeezer.\r\n\r\nLOMOV: Better!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Worse!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: Well, that's a way to start your family bliss! Have some champagne!\r\n\r\nLOMOV: He's better!\r\n\r\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA: Worse! worse! worse!\r\n\r\nCHUBUKOV: [Trying to shout her down] Champagne! Champagne!\r\n\r\nCURTAIN",

        "prologue": "",
        "content": "MY grandmother, like everybody\u2019s grandmother, was an old\r\nwoman. She had been old and wrinkled for the twenty years\r\nthat I had known her. People said that she had once been\r\nyoung and pretty and had even had a husband, but that was\r\nhard to believe. My grandfather\u2019s portrait hung above the\r\nmantelpiece in the drawing room. He wore a big turban and\r\nloose-fitting clothes. His long, white beard covered the best\r\npart of his chest and he looked at least a hundred years old.\r\nHe did not look the sort of person who would have a wife or\r\nchildren. He looked as if he could only have lots and lots of\r\ngrandchildren. As for my grandmother being young and pretty,\r\nthe thought was almost revolting. She often told us of the\r\ngames she used to play as a child. That seemed quite absurd\r\nand undignified on her part and we treated it like the fables\r\nof the Prophets she used to tell us.\r\nShe had always been short and fat and slightly bent. Her\r\nface was a criss-cross of wrinkles running from everywhere to\r\neverywhere. No, we were certain she had always been as we had\r\nknown her. Old, so terribly old that she could not have grown\r\nolder, and had stayed at the same age for twenty years. She\r\ncould never have been pretty; but she was always beautiful.\r\nShe hobbled about the house in spotless white with one hand\r\nresting on her waist to balance her stoop and the other telling\r\nthe beads of her rosary. Her silver locks were scattered untidily\r\nover her pale, puckered face, and her lips constantly moved in\r\ninaudible prayer. Yes, she was beautiful. She was like the winter\r\nlandscape in the mountains, an expanse of pure white serenity\r\nbreathing peace and contentment.\r\nMy grandmother and I were good friends. My parents left me\r\nwith her when they went to live in the city and we were constantly\r\ntogether. She used to wake me up in the morning and get me\r\nready for school. She said her morning prayer in a monotonous\r\nsing-song while she bathed and dressed me in the hope that I\r\nwould listen and get to know it by heart; I listened because I\r\nloved her voice but never bothered to learn it. Then she would\r\nfetch my wooden slate which she had already washed and\r\nplastered with yellow chalk, a tiny earthen ink-pot and a red\r\npen, tie them all in a bundle and hand it to me. After a breakfast\r\nof a thick, stale chapatti with a little butter and sugar spread on\r\nit, we went to school. She carried several stale chapattis with\r\nher for the village dogs.\r\nMy grandmother always went to school with me because\r\nthe school was attached to the temple. The priest taught us\r\nthe alphabet and the morning prayer. While the children sat in\r\nrows on either side of the verandah singing the alphabet or the\r\nprayer in a chorus, my grandmother sat inside reading the\r\nscriptures. When we had both finished, we would walk back\r\ntogether. This time the village dogs would meet us at the temple\r\ndoor. They followed us to our home growling and fighting with\r\neach other for the chapattis we threw to them.\r\nWhen my parents were comfortably settled in the city, they\r\nsent for us. That was a turning-point in our friendship. Although\r\nwe shared the same room, my grandmother no longer came to\r\nschool with me. I used to go to an English school in a motor\r\nbus. There were no dogs in the streets and she took to feeding\r\nsparrows in the courtyard of our city house.\r\nAs the years rolled by we saw less of each other. For some\r\ntime she continued to wake me up and get me ready for school.\r\nWhen I came back she would ask me what the teacher had\r\ntaught me. I would tell her English words and little things of\r\nwestern science and learning, the law of gravity, Archimedes\u2019\r\nPrinciple, the world being round, etc. This made her unhappy.\r\nShe could not help me with my lessons. She did not believe in\r\nthe things they taught at the English school and was distressed\r\nthat there was no teaching about God and the scriptures. One\r\nday I announced that we were being given music lessons. She\r\nwas very disturbed. To her music had lewd associations. It was\r\nthe monopoly of harlots and beggars and not meant for gentlefolk.\r\nShe said nothing but her silence meant disapproval. She rarely\r\ntalked to me after that.\r\nWhen I went up to University, I was given a room of my own.\r\nThe common link of friendship was snapped. My grandmother\r\naccepted her seclusion with resignation. She rarely left her\r\nspinning-wheel to talk to anyone. From sunrise to sunset she\r\nsat by her wheel spinning and reciting prayers. Only in the\r\nafternoon she relaxed for a while to feed the sparrows. While\r\nshe sat in the verandah breaking the bread into little bits,\r\nhundreds of little birds collected round her creating a veritable\r\nbedlam of chirrupings. Some came and perched on her legs,\r\nothers on her shoulders. Some even sat on her head. She smiled\r\nbut never shooed them away. It used to be the happiest halfhour\r\nof the day for her.\r\nWhen I decided to go abroad for further studies, I was sure\r\nmy grandmother would be upset. I would be away for five years,\r\nand at her age one could never tell. But my grandmother could.\r\nShe was not even sentimental. She came to leave me at the\r\nrailway station but did not talk or show any emotion. Her lips\r\nmoved in prayer, her mind was lost in prayer. Her fingers were\r\nbusy telling the beads of her rosary. Silently she kissed my\r\nforehead, and when I left I cherished the moist imprint as perhaps\r\nthe last sign of physical contact between us.\r\nBut that was not so. After five years I came back home and\r\nwas met by her at the station. She did not look a day older. She\r\nstill had no time for words, and while she clasped me in her\r\narms I could hear her reciting her prayers. Even on the first day\r\nof my arrival, her happiest moments were with her sparrows\r\nwhom she fed longer and with frivolous rebukes.\r\nIn the evening a change came over her. She did not pray.\r\nShe collected the women of the neighbourhood, got an old drum\r\nand started to sing. For several hours she thumped the sagging\r\nskins of the dilapidated drum and sang of the home-coming\r\nof warriors. We had to persuade her to stop to avoid\r\noverstraining. That was the first time since I had known her\r\nthat she did not pray.\r\nThe next morning she was taken ill. It was a mild fever and\r\nthe doctor told us that it would go. But my grandmother thought\r\ndifferently. She told us that her end was near. She said that,\r\nsince only a few hours before the close of the last chapter of her\r\nlife she had omitted to pray, she was not going to waste any\r\nmore time talking to us.\r\nWe protested. But she ignored our protests. She lay peacefully\r\nin bed praying and telling her beads. Even before we could\r\nsuspect, her lips stopped moving and the rosary fell from her\r\nlifeless fingers. A peaceful pallor spread on her face and we knew\r\nthat she was dead.We lifted her off the bed and, as is customary, laid her on\r\nthe ground and covered her with a red shroud. After a few hours\r\nof mourning we left her alone to make arrangements for her\r\nfuneral. In the evening we went to her room with a crude stretcher\r\nto take her to be cremated. The sun was setting and had lit her\r\nroom and verandah with a blaze of golden light. We stopped\r\nhalf-way in the courtyard. All over the verandah and in her room\r\nright up to where she lay dead and stiff wrapped in the red\r\nshroud, thousands of sparrows sat scattered on the floor. There\r\nwas no chirruping. We felt sorry for the birds and my mother\r\nfetched some bread for them. She broke it into little crumbs,\r\nthe way my grandmother used to, and threw it to them. The\r\nsparrows took no notice of the bread. When we carried my\r\ngrandmother\u2019s corpse off, they flew away quietly. Next morning\r\nthe sweeper swept the bread crumbs into the dustbin.",

They loved one another deeply. When he left the\ncountry and moved abroad for higher studies, she went to the railway station to send him off. She quietly\nkissed his forehead and showed no emotion.
