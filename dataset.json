        "content": "Narrator : Ring! Ring! Ring! Off goes the alarm clock at six in the morning. Neha makes a face and covering her ears with a pillow, snuggles under the warm blanket. But she knows she has to get up. She mutters to herself.\r\nNeha : This alarm clock always rings at six and pulls me out of the bed! It\u2019s so unfair...Oh, how I would love to sleep a little longer in the morning! I wish this clock would forget its job sometimes.\r\nNarrator : Something falls. Neha smiles.\r\nNeha : Oh! My clock has fallen. How happy I am! Tomorrow I can get up late.\r\nNarrator : Next morning there is no alarm. So Neha sleeps and sleeps. The small chirpy birds which come to the window sill every morning find Neha still sleeping.\r\nBirds : Wake up dear! Wake up fast!\r\nNarrator : Neha gets up with a start.\r\nNeha : Oh, no! If it\u2019s not the alarm clock, it\u2019s these birds\u2026 why don\u2019t they leave me alone?\r\nNarrator : Even this wish of Neha\u2019s comes true. The next morning there is not only no alarm clock, there are no birds either. But there is someone else who does not want her to miss the school bus. Can you guess who it is? The big bright Sun! He fills Neha\u2019s room with a warm smile.\r\nNeha : Oh, my eyes! Now it\u2019s the Sun waking me up! Why can\u2019t he let me be?\r\nNarrator : Even this wish of Neha\u2019s comes true. Next morning the Sun is behind the clouds. So, Neha snores till she hears her mother\u2019s voice...\r\nMother : Wake up, sleepy head. You will miss the bus.\r\nNeha : Oh no! Why does mother have to wake me up?\r\nNarrator : There is no escape now. Neha gets up and gets ready. Can you imagine what happens the next day? Neha wakes up with a start. Her watch says it is six o\u2019clock. She calls out to her mother.\r\nNeha : Ma, who woke me up today?\r\nNarrator : Mother smiles.\r\nMother : Who else? You, of course!\r\nNeha : But, I was sleeping, how could I \u2026?\r\nMother : Now, tell me, why do you eat your lunch every day at one in the afternoon?\r\nNeha : I feel hungry.\r\nMother : Why do you sleep at nine every night?\r\nNeha : Because I feel sleepy.\r\nMother : There is a clock inside you which tells you when to eat, when to sleep and when to wake up.\r\nNeha : Oh! Ooh! I better rush now. I don\u2019t want to miss the bus.\r\nMother : RELAX! Today is Sunday!\r\nNeha : Oh! Oh! Oh!",

Before the mouth was made, it began to laugh. \u201cStop laughing!\u201d the old man said.\r\nIt did stop, but as soon as his back was turned, it put out its tongue. And its nose grew long.\r\nNo sooner were its hands ready than it snatched off the carpenter\u2019s wig and put it on its own head. And then Pinocchio\u2019s nose grew longer.\r\nWhen its legs and feet were made, they were too stiff to use, so the carpenter showed Pinocchio how to use them.\r\nNow, the carpenter decided to send Pinocchio to school. But there, Pinocchio did nothing but look for fun. He often ran away from school.\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to school?\u201d asked the carpenter. Pinocchio told him a lie... and his nose started growing longer and longer.\r\nEach time he was rude to someone or told a lie, his nose grew longer. Finally, Pinocchio said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be a real boy. I\u2019ll never lie again.\u201d\r\n",

Its leafy branches spread out like strong arms.\r\nThis tree was the home of a flock of wild geese. They felt safe there. One of the geese was a wise old bird.\r\nHe noticed a small creeper at the foot of the tree.\r\nHe spoke to the other birds about it.\r\n\u201cDo you see that creeper?\u201d he said to them. \u201cLet us destroy it\u201d. \u201cWhy must we destroy it?\u201d asked the geese in surprise. \u201cIt is so small. What harm can it do?\u201d \u201cMy friends,\u201d replied the wise old bird, \u201cthat little creeper will soon grow. As it creeps up this tree, it will become thick and strong.\u201d \r\n\u201cWhat of that?\u201d asked the geese. \u201cWhat harm can a creeper do us?\u201d\r\n\u201cDon't you see?\u201d replied the wise bird, \u201cwith the help of that creeper, it will be possible for someone to climb this tree. A hunter can come up and kill us all.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no hurry,\u201d they replied, \u201cthe creeper is very small. It would be a pity to destroy it now.\u201d\r\n\u201cDestroy the creeper while it is still young,\u201d the old bird advised. \u201cNow it is tender and you can cut it easily. Later it will become hard and you will not be able to cut it.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d answered the birds. But they did not destroy the creeper. They forgot the wise old bird\u2019s advice. As the creeper grew, it began winding its way up the tree.\r\nStronger and stronger it became, until it was as strong as a thick rope.\r\nOne morning when the geese had gone out in search of food, a hunter came to the forest. \r\n\u201cSo this is where the wild geese live,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhen they come back in the evening, I shall catch them.\u201d\r\nThe hunter climbed up the tree with the help of the creeper. He got to the top and spread his net there. Then he climbed down and went away.\r\nIn the evening, the geese returned home. They did not notice the net. As they flew into the tree, they were trapped. They struggled hard to get out, but could not. \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d cried the geese. \u201cWe are caught in the hunter\u2019s net. Oh! What shall we do?\u201d\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss now,\u201d said the wise old bird. \u201cLong ago I told you to destroy the creeper, but you did not. Now see what has happened. Tomorrow morning the hunter will come back and kill us all.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe were foolish,\u201d wept the birds. \u201cWe are very sorry we did not listen to you. Please tell us what to do?\u201d\r\n\u201cThen listen carefully,\u201d replied the wise bird. \u201cWhen the hunter comes you must all pretend to be dead. Just lie still. The hunter will not want dead birds. He will throw us to the ground. It will then be easy for him to climb down, collect the dead birds, and takethem home. When the last of us has been thrown down, we must quickly get up and fly away.\u201d\r\nIn the morning the hunter came to the tree and climbed up. He looked at the geese in the net.\r\n\u201cThey are all dead,\u201d he muttered to himself.\r\nHe threw them out of the net one by one. The birds lay still until the last one had been thrown down. Then, all at once, they got up, flapped their wings, and flew away.\r\nThe hunter was taken by surprise. From the top of the tree he watched all the geese fly away.\r\n",

        "content": "\r\nRobinson Crusoe's ship had been destroyed by the sea. He had been alone for many years and longed for\r\ncompany. One day he discovers a footprint on the sand. Let's find out what he did then.\r\n\r\nOne day, when I was going towards my boat, I was surprised to see the footprint of a man on the sand. I stood amazed! I listened; I looked around me; I could neither hear nor see anything. I went up higher to look down; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was no good; I could find no other footprint but that one. I went to it again to see if there were any more footprints and to tell if it had been my imagination. But I was not mistaken, for there was exactly the print of a foot \u2014 toes, heel, every part of a foot. I could not imagine how it came there.\r\nI stayed a long time thinking, but became more and more confused. At last I returned home very frightened, looking behind\r\nme after every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree to be a man.\r\nWhen I came to my cave (which I called my castle), I ran inside it, as if I was being chased. I do not remember whether I used the ladder or went in by the hole in the rock, which I called the door. I ran for cover, faster than any animal could run.\r\nI did not sleep that night. The more I thought about what I had seen, the more afraid I became. I thought it could be one of the savages of the mainland who had wandered out to the sea, in a small boat.\r\nLuckily I was not on shore at that time, but what if he had seen my boat! If he had seen the boat he would have realised that someone lived on the island and would soon return with others to kill and eat me.\r\nAnd so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for protection. In doing so, I was much comforted and began going out to investigate. But even now as I went forward,looked behind me frequently, because I was still\r\nvery frightened. However, as I went about for two or three days and saw nothing I became a little bolder. I decided to go down to the shore again and examine the footprint once more. I decided to measure it with my own footmark.\r\nAs I came closer to the footprint, I realised that it could not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of the beach since a long time. Secondly, as I placed my foot alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own.\r\nMy fear returned! I went home again, believing that there was someone there.\r\nThe island was inhabited!\r\n",

        "content": "\r\nThis short play is about two brothers who are affectionateand respectful to each other. The story also shows that learning from our day to day experiences is as important as what we learn from books in the school. This play is based on the famous story in Hindi-Bade Bhai Saheb written by Munshi Premchand.\r\n\r\nSCENE 1\r\nA hostel room. Two brothers aged 9 and 14 years, sitting at a study table. The elder brother, Bhaiya, is reading a book and the younger one, Munna, is drawing pictures of birds and animals.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nWhat are you doing, Munna?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI am drawing.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nWhen will you study? Where were you in the morning?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI was playing. Bhaiya, how can you sit with a book for hours together?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nThat's because I want my foundation in education to be very strong. If the base is strong, then the building will stand firmly. Sometimes it takes me two years to do one year's work.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, you are five years older than I am and three classes ahead of me. I wonder why you keep writing the same word twenty times, one sentence more than twenty times, and copy poems several times in beautiful letters?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nYou know, studying English is no child's play. One has to work very hard in order to learn the subject. To speak or write English properly, tremendous effort is required. But the moment you get a chance, you run to the field, play marbles, fly paper kites, or sit idling away with friends for fun! Can\u2019t you sit down and study?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(turning pale)\r\nOh Bhaiya, there is a big mela in the village today. Should we go?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nHave you ever seen me going to a fair or watching a cricket or hockey match? I don't go near them. I prefer to study a book. I don't mind repeating a class for more than two years. But you might stay in the same class all your life. Do you expect to pass if you waste your time playing all the time? You are simply wasting father's hard-earned money.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, I feel like running away and going back home.\r\n(Munna starts crying; sobbing sounds \"wah, wah, bah, bah, hu, hu\" are heard.)\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nNow, now! Stop crying. Put on a nice smile. Look, I will make a timetable for you to follow. Get up at dawn.\r\n\r\nTime | Schedule\r\n\r\n6 AM | Wash your hands\r\n6-8 AM | English\r\n8-9 AM | Maths\r\n9-9:30 AM | History\r\n3:30 PM | Off to school\r\n5-6 PM | Grammar\r\n6:30-7 PM | English composition\r\n8-9 PM | Translation\r\n9-10 PM | Hindi\r\n10-11 PM | Other subjects, then to bed\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBut when is the time to play?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nPlay? What is the need, Munna?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh! I love the green fields, the gentle breeze. I want to jump up like a football! I like the touch-and-go and the sounds of the hu tu tu and the hurry and flurry of volleyball. It pulls me like a magnet. As soon as I am on the field, I forget everything.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAlas! I have failed once again.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh! But Bhaiya, I have passed and topped my class. Now there is only two years difference between us.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nBut my dear brother, don't be so proud. You have passed only one class and you think that I'm stupid and you are smart. Once in a while, in a game, you might get lucky and hit a goal, but that does not mean you have mastered the game. You have to work hard to be successful in life. When you have to study a subject like Algebra or Geometry in higher classes, then you will understand the importance of hard work.\r\n\r\nIn Geometry, if one writes \u2018acb\u2019 instead of \u2018abc,\u2019 the answer is marked wrong. The examiners will not spare you. They want you to learn word by word from the textbooks.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nOh, Bhaisaheb! This is scary. I don\u2019t think I want to go to the 9th class now, but I will still complete my day\u2019s homework so that I get no punishment in class. Just today, we were asked to write a short essay on the topic of Punctuality in four pages! And imagine, can something be written on four pages and still be short? It\u2019s all so mixed up! Thank God, it was time for school, or else, the scolding would have gone on and on.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(thinking aloud)\r\nAh! I am lucky. I can pass easily. I need not study so hard. Now I can play games with my friends and fly kites. But I should still be careful that Bhaiya does not see me flying kites.\r\n\r\nSCENE 2\r\nThe final exams are over and the results are out.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\n(talking aloud)\r\nThe results were out once again and it so happened that I passed, and Bhaiya failed again. Bhaiya was really upset. I was also sad seeing my brother so unhappy. Bhaiya now became gentler with me. I, in turn, became naughtier and studied even less than before.\r\n\r\n(One day a kite is flying slowly downwards. Munna starts running in order to grab it. Suddenly, he comes face to face with Bhaiya.)\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAren't you ashamed to be playing kites all day long? Don't you realize that now you are in the eighth class and not studying in a lower class? If you think that I am just one class ahead of you and I can't say anything, you are wrong. I am five years older than you are and will always be. Understanding doesn\u2019t come only from reading books. Look at Ma and Baba. Ma has never gone to school and Baba has only passed the fifth class.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nReally Bhaiya! Is that true?\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nYes! There are a thousand things that they know more than you or me. And even if we have studied the wisdom of the whole world, Ma and Baba will always have the right to explain to us and correct us. Now, what would you do if I were to fall sick today?\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nI don't know, Bhaiya! I would tell Baba and he would rush to the hostel.\r\n\r\nBHAIYA\r\nAha! I had expected this answer. Now, Baba would not get upset. He would first try to find out what was wrong and then he would call a doctor. Baba would know exactly what to do. They have more experience than us.\r\n\r\nMUNNA\r\nBhaiya, I am sorry. What you say is true. I also like to play and fly kites. But if I also play, then how can I watch out for you? You are my responsibility.\r\nI love you, Bhaiya!\r\n",

        "content": "\r\nThis story is about Rip Van Winkle, a good-natured but lazy man, who goes away into the hills and falls asleep. When he awakens twenty years later, Rip finds that quite a few things have changed!\r\n\r\nMany years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill) mountains, was a little village. In the village lived a simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle. He was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. Everyone in the village liked him. The children of the village shouted with joy whenever they saw him because he played with them, he taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories.\r\nThe only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy. He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his time. His fences were falling to pieces. His cow was going astray. Weeds grew on his farm. Rip's constant companion was his dog, named Wolf. To avoid work, he would walk away into the forest with his dog.\r\nOne day, Rip just walked on and on and reached the highest part of the mountains. It was late in the afternoon when he reached there. Tired after his long climb, he lay down and began daydreaming. It was soon evening and he realised it would be night by the time he reached his village.\r\nSuddenly, he heard a voice calling out, \u201cRip Van Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!\u201d He looked around and saw a short, old man, with thick hair and a grizzled beard walking towards him with a barrel. He made signs to help him carry the barrel. Rip hurried to help the stranger who caught his hand tightly. Together they reached a place where there were some more odd looking men, playing ninepins. They were all dressed the same way and all of them had beards of various shapes and colours. Even though they were playing a game, their faces were serious and there was silence! The only sound was the noise of the balls, which echoed in the mountains like thunder.\r\nAs Rip and his companion reached them, they stopped playing and stared at Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip was really frightened. His companion emptied the contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it. Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear. Since he was thirsty he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a deep sleep.\r\nOn waking up, he found that he was at the place where he had first met the old man. He rubbed his eyes \u2014 it was a bright sunny morning. \u201cSurely, I have not slept here all night,\u201d thought Rip.\r\nHe looked around for Wolf, but he was nowhere. Rip whistled for him. \u201cWolf! Wolf!\u201d he then shouted. No dog was to be seen. \u201cWhere has this dog gone?\u201d he muttered to himself. He began to descend the mountain to go back to his village.\r\nAs he neared the village, he met a number of people but he didn't know any of them. The villagers also stared at him equally surprised. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d said one.\r\n\u201cI've never seen him before,\u201d said another, \u201clook at his long white beard and his wrinkled face.\u201d\r\nOn hearing this, Rip stroked his chin and, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long, and it was all white!\r\nAn old woman walked up to him and looked at his face for a moment. Then she exclaimed \u2014 \u201cIt is Rip Van Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbour! Where have you been these twenty long years?\r\n",

Their names are Bacbone (buk-bon), Bakbarea (buk-buria), Bakbac (buk-buk), Alcouz\r\n(ul-kooz), Alnaschee (ul-nashi) and Schacabac( sha-ka-bak). One is humpbacked, one is toothless, one is half blind, one is quite blind, one is deaf and the other has a defect in his speech and they are all great talkers, but I am the youngest of my family, and I am very quiet and sparing with words.\u201d\r\n\u201cGive him three pieces of gold,\u201d the Sultan cried, losing all patience, \u201cand send him away. I will not be shaved today.\u201d\r\n\u201cMy Master,\u201d cried the Barber, \u201cit was not I who came to seek you, it was you who ordered me to come. So I will not quit your house till I have shaved you.\u201d\r\nHe then began narrating another story, which lasted half an hour.\r\n\u201cStop making your fine speeches and let me go quickly. I have an affair of the greatest importance. I have to go out at noon,\u201d said the Sultan.\r\nWhen he saw that the Sultan was really angry with him, the Barber said, \u201cO Master, do not be angry, I will begin to shave you.\u201d Saying this, he washed the Sultan\u2019s head and began to shave. But he had not touched him even four times with the razor, when he stopped and said, \u201cMy Master, you are acting hastily in this matter.\u201d\r\n\u201cGo on shaving me, speak no more\u201d, ordered the Sultan.\r\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d said the barber, \u201cperhaps you have not considered well what you were going to do. I wish you would tell me what this matter of great importance is all about and then I will give you my opinion on it.\u201d\r\n\u201cFinish shaving at once,\u201d the Sultan exclaimed. But, instead of doing this, the Barber left the Sultan half-shaved to go and see what time it was.\u201c My patience is exhausted,\u201d the Sultan cried.\r\n\u201cBe calm, my Master and you shall be shaved in a moment,\u201d said the Barber and saying this, he continued shaving the Sultan. But while he was doing this, he could not help talking.\r\n\u201cIf you could inform me what this important affair is, I would give more advice, which you might find useful,\u201d he said.\r\nThe Sultan was completely fed up by now and decided to satisfy the barber. He told him that he was giving a feast to some friends at noon which was why he was in a hurry to leave.\r\nWhen the barber heard the Sultan mention a feast he exclaimed, \u201cThat reminds me. Yesterday, I invited four or five friends to come to my house today. But I had quite forgotten it and have not made any preparations for them.\u201d The Sultan who was at the mercy of the Barber, was ready to do anything to be rid of him. \r\n\u201cBe quick and finish your work,\u201d the Sultan replied, \u201cand you shall have all the food that has been prepared for me today.\u201d\r\n\u201cPlease show me the food so that I may judge if it is enough for my five friends.\u201d\r\n\u201cI have enough food for you!\u201d the Sultan exclaimed. But he ordered that all the food prepared for his feast be brought in.\r\nThe Barber looked over the food and said \u201cThis is very good but I shall want some fruit for the dessert also.\u201d The Sultan, in desperation, since his head was half shaved, ordered that the fruits should also be brought in. The Barber left off shaving the Sultan to examine each dish separately. This took up half an hour.\r\nThe Sultan stamped his feet impatiently but the Barber did not hurry.\r\nAt length, however, he again took up the razor but after a few minutes of work, stopped suddenly and cried, \u201cI never knew that you were so generous.\u201d\r\n",

        "content": "\r\nWhen a person tells the story of his life in his own words it is called an autobiography. Gulliver, a sailor, was once caught in the land of Giants. This is how he describes his experience.\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June 1730 we discovered land. Our captain sent a dozen men with vessels for water, if any could be found. When we came to land we saw no river or spring nor any inhabitants. I went on to explore. The country was barren and rocky. I turned back to join the crew, only to see them getting into the boat and rowing for life to get to the ship.\r\nBefore I could reach them I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could. The water of the ocean reached only till his knees! However, the monster was unable to overtake the speeding boat. I turned back quickly and climbed up a steep hill with fields of barley on either side and the corn rising upto forty feet. There was a fence to pass from one field to the other.\r\nIt was impossible for me to climb because every step was six feet high. I was trying to find a gap in the hedge when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field walking towards the fence. He was of the same size as the creature chasing the boat. I was struck with utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself. He called in a voice much louder than a trumpet. It sounded like thunder! Seven monsters like him came towards the field ready to reap the corn. They carried a reaping hook which was very big. When one of the reapers approached where I lay hidden I screamed as loud as I could. The creature stopped reaping, picked me up between his thumb and forefinger and brought me close to his eyes, sixty feet above the ground. He looked at me with curiosity and blew my hair aside to get a better view of my face.\r\nHe called his friends and gently placed me on the ground.\r\nThey all sat on the ground to take a good look at me. I walked slowly backward and forward, pulled off my hat and made a low bow towards the farmers. I tried to speak to them loudly in several languages. Each time I did so the farmer who picked me up held his ear very close to me but in vain. The farmer took me to his house and placed me at some distance on the dining table which was thirty feet high from the floor.\r\nDinner was brought for the farmer in a dish which was ten feet in diameter. The farmer's wife crumbled some bread and placed it before me. In the middle of the dinner I heard a noise behind me. It was the purring of a cat that was ten times larger than an ox. The farmer's wife was stroking him. Then entered the farmer's one year-old son in the arms of a lady. On seeing me the child grabbed me from the table and put my head into his mouth. I shouted so loudly that the baby dropped me. I would have broken my neck if the mother had not held her apron under me. Later she put me on her own bed and covered me with a clean white handkerchief.\r\nI slept dreaming of my home, my wife and my children.\r\n",

        "content": "\r\nDo you know of any child who teases others or pushes them around? What would you call such a child?\r\nRead this story and see how Hari, a little boy troubles other children.\r\n---\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a small boy called Hari. Although he wasn\u2019t very big, he was strong, and he loved to tease all the boys and girls who went to school with him. What he loved to do most was to pinch. He could make a big bruise appear in half a second. Another trick he played was pricking people with a pin.\r\nSo you can guess how all the children hated him. They tried pinching him back, but that was no good because he could always pinch harder. They didn't like telling their teacher, because that was telling tales.\r\nIt so happened that the class went for a picnic to the seaside for a whole day. All the children were most excited. \r\nOn that day, the sun shone bright, and all the children were wild with excitement. They crowded into the train and sat down \u2014 but nobody wanted to sit next to Hari because he always pinched.\r\nWhen they arrived at the seaside, out jumped all the children with a shout of joy. Down to the sands they raced, hand in hand \u2014 but nobody took Hari\u2019s hand.Nobody went near him.\r\nHari was angry. He went to a sandy corner near a rocky pool and sat down by himself. He took out his lunch and looked at it. It was a good lunch. There were two hard-boiled eggs, six jam sandwiches, three pieces of bread and butter, a ginger cake, and a bar of chocolate.\r\nHe would eat it all by himself. He wouldn't offer anything to anyone!\r\nJust as he was beginning on the eggs, he heard a hoarse voice near him. \u201cGood morning! I am so pleased to meet a boy like you.\u201d Hari turned around and stared in fright. Whatever do you think he saw?\r\nHari saw a monster crab walking sideways out of the pool. His eyes were on the ends of short stalks and he looked most queer. He held out his front claw to Hari. Hari put out his hand to shake the crab\u2019s claw, but to his surprise and anger the crab opened his pincers and nipped his hand so hard that the little boy yelled.\r\n\u201cAh, here is my good cousin,\u201d said the crab pleasantly, and, to Hari\u2019s horror, he saw a large sandy lobster crawling heavily out of the pool. Before the little boy could stop him the lobster took his hand in his great pincer-like claws and pinched it so hard that Hari yelled in pain. Then he stared at the pool in surprise, for, out came sandy-coloured shrimps and prawns, more crabs, and another large lobster and they pricked Hari till he was soon black and blue with their pinching.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d said all the creatures in surprise.\r\n\u201cWhy, we were told you would love to see us because you were a champion pincher and pricker yourself. Come, come join in the fun!\u201d\r\nHari leapt to his feet, crying loudly. His lunch rolled into the pool, and when the crabs and lobsters saw it they ran to it and began to feast eagerly. Hari saw that they had forgotten him for a time, and he turned and ran for his life, tears streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\u201cThey only did to me what I keep doing to the other children,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut how it hurt! And how I hated those crabs and lobsters! I suppose the other children hate me too. Well, I jolly well shan\u2019t pinch or prick any more.\u201d\r\n",

        "prologue": "A king is called a Ningthou\r\nand a queen is called a Leima\r\nin Manipuri. This is a story\r\nfrom Manipur about what qualities\r\nmake a good ruler",
        "content": "\r\nLong, long ago, in the land of Kangleipak in Manipur, there lived a Ningthou and a Leima. They were loved dearly by the people.\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima, on their part, never stopped thinking about their meeyam, their people. \u201cOur meeyam should be happy,\u201d they said.\r\nThe people were not the only ones who loved their Ningthou and Leima. The birds and animals too loved them. The Ningthou and Leima always said: \u201cEverybody in Kangleipak should live in peace. Not only the people, but the birds, animals and trees.\u201d\r\nTheir beloved king and queen had three sons: Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba.\r\nTwelve years later, a daughter was born. She was named Sanatombi. She was a lovely child, soft and beautiful inside. She was loved by one and all.\r\nThe years went by, and the children grew up well. And then one day, the Ningthou called all his ministers and said: \u201cIt is now time to decide the Tunggi Ningthou, the future king.\u201d\r\nThe ministers were shocked. \u201cBut O Ningthou, what is there to decide? Sanajaoba, your eldest son, will be our future king.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the Ningthou replied. \u201cThat\u2019s how it happened in the old days. The eldest son always became the king. But times have changed. So let us select a king who is most worthy of becoming a king.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe will have a contest to select the future king,\u201d the Leima said. And so, in the land of Kangleipak, there was a contest, a horse race. Whoever reached the khongnang, the banyan tree, first would be declared Tunggi Ningthou.\r\nBut then, a strange thing happened. Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba all three of them finished the race together. They were expert riders and all three reached the finish line at the same time!\r\nThere was great excitement. \u201cLook at them!\u201d the people shouted. \u201cShagol thauba nupa, such fine horsemen!\u201d\r\nBut one question remained: Who would be the Tunggi Ningthou?\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima turned to their sons. The Ningthou said, \u201cSanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba, you have proved that you are fine horsemen. Do something different each one of you, so that we can decide who will be Tunggi Ningthou.\u201d\r\nSuddenly, Sanajaoba mounted his horse and held his spear straight in front of him. He looked around. There was a hush among people. \u201cWhat is Sanajaoba, the eldest, going to do? They thought to themselves.\r\nSanajaoba then looked at the huge khongnang standing majestically in the distance. He pierced the tree and jumped his horse right through it!\r\n\u201cBravo! Bravo!\u201d The people shouted. \u201cThouro! Thouro!\u201d And then they fell silent.\r\nNow it was the turn of the second son, Sanayaima. What would he do? Sanayaima too looked at the khongnang as he mounted his horse. Then he too rode towards the tree, harder and harder. The people watched in silence, afraid even to breathe. When he was really close, he urged his horse to jump. Higher and higher the horse rose until horse and rider jumped clear over the huge tree and landed on the other side in a wonderful motion.\r\nThe people breathed in relief and said in unison: \u201cPhajei ! Phajei ! Wonderful ! Wonderful !\r\nAnd now, it was the turn of the youngest son, Sanatomba. He, too, rode his horse towards the khongnang and, before anybody knew what was happening, uprooted it. Triumphantly he carried the tree to the Ningthou and Leima and laid it at their feet! \r\nShouts of Thouro ! Thouro ! Phajei ! Phajei !\u201d filled the mountains.\r\nThe people grew restless. Why were the Ningthou and the Leima taking so long to make the announcement? They craned their necks to see what was happening.\r\nThe Ningthou and Leima were watching Sanatombi, their five year-old daughter. She looked sad and lonely. She stared at the khongnang which lay dead by the throne. Birds flapped worriedly around, searching for their homes in the tree. Sanatombi walked up to the khongnang and whispered, \u201cThe khongnang is dead. It was hurt by the spear and now it is dead.\u201d\r\nThe people were all attention. The Ningthou stood up. He looked at the three boys. He looked at the little girl. He turned to the people. \u201cIf anybody is worthy of becoming the ruler,\u201d he said, \u201cit is little Sanatombi. It was she who told us to look at the soul of the khongnang. Sanatombi feels the pain of others. She feels the pain of the people, the animals, the birds, the trees.\u201d\r\n\u201dI declare Sanatombi the future Leima of Kangleipak,\u201d\r\nthe Ningthou said. A silence fell. Everyone turned to look at the little girl, their future queen. There she stood, all of five, like a small khongnang, with birds flying all around her. They sat on her shoulders and on her head. She held out her hands full of grain and the birds flapped about her, pecking at the food.\r\n\u201cA Leima is one who doesn\u2019t hurt anybody in the kingdom.\u201d\r\n",
