However, they did not question her presence, and the girl, feeling quite grown-up, enjoyed the experience of being treated with respect and maturity.

Q5: How does the bus ride symbolize the girl's growing independence?

The Sermon at Benares (by Khushwant Singh)
Thinking about the Text
Q1: What was the nature of the sermon that the Buddha gave at Benares?
A1: The sermon that the Buddha gave at Benares was a profound teaching on the nature of suffering and how to overcome it. In this sermon, the Buddha spoke about the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering (Dukkha), the truth of the cause of suffering (Craving or attachment), the truth of the cessation of suffering (Nirvana), and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (The Eightfold Path). The Buddha emphasized that by understanding these truths and following the path of self-discipline and mindfulness, one could end suffering and attain enlightenment.

Q2: What was the attitude of the people towards the Buddha’s teachings?

By the end of the sermon, many of them had understood the significance of his message and were ready to follow his teachings.

Q3: How does the story of the Buddha’s sermon highlight the idea of detachment and renunciation?

Q4: How did the Buddha react when he saw the young man approach him for help?

Instead of offering immediate comfort or relief, the Buddha gave him a deeper understanding of the nature of suffering. He explained that suffering was a result of attachment and that true peace could only come from understanding and detaching oneself from desires. The Buddha’s calm and wise demeanor helped the young man realize the true source of his suffering and how to transcend it.

The Proposal (by Anton Chekhov)
Thinking about the Text
Q1: How does Lomov try to convince himself that he is healthy?
A1: Lomov tries to convince himself that he is healthy by making self-assurances and listing all the positive aspects of his health. He mentions that his doctor has given him a clean bill of health and that he does not have any serious ailments. However, his exaggerated need to prove his healthiness also highlights his anxieties and lack of self-confidence. Despite his claims, his behavior shows that he is more worried about his health than he admits.

Q2: Why does Lomov visit Chubukov’s house?
A2: Lomov visits Chubukov’s house with the intention of proposing marriage to Chubukov’s daughter, Natalya. He has come to ask for her hand in marriage, although he is quite nervous and unsure about how to approach the subject. Lomov’s visit is also influenced by his desire to settle down and ensure that he is not left alone, as he is getting older and worried about his health.

Q3: How does the conversation between Lomov and Natalya begin?
A3: The conversation between Lomov and Natalya begins on an awkward note. Lomov initially tries to talk about the purpose of his visit, but the conversation takes a sudden turn when they begin to argue about their respective dogs. Lomov mentions that he has a dog named "Guess," and Natalya counters by saying that her dog, "Squeezer," is superior. This argument over dogs distracts Lomov from his original purpose of proposing marriage, leading to a series of misunderstandings and comic situations.

Q4: Why does Lomov think Natalya will refuse his proposal?
A4: Lomov thinks Natalya will refuse his proposal because of his own insecurities and anxieties. He feels that he is not wealthy enough or socially important enough to secure her approval, and he is unsure of how to present his proposal. Furthermore, his nervousness and the misunderstandings that arise during the conversation make him second-guess his decision to ask for her hand in marriage. However, despite his fears, Natalya seems to have her own feelings for him, though their interaction becomes increasingly comical and absurd.

Q5: How does Natalya react when Lomov proposes to her?
A5: Natalya initially does not realize that Lomov is proposing to her and continues arguing about trivial matters, such as the superiority of their dogs. However, when Lomov finally makes it clear that he wants to marry her, Natalya’s reaction is quite emotional and dramatic. She becomes excited and accepts his proposal, but her joy is quickly overshadowed by the continuation of their petty arguments. The proposal is filled with misunderstandings and arguments, making it humorous despite the serious intentions behind it.

Q6: What is the role of the dog argument in the play?
A6: The argument over the dogs plays a significant role in the comedy of the play. It serves as a distraction from Lomov’s proposal and demonstrates the petty nature of the characters. The argument escalates unnecessarily, with both Lomov and Natalya stubbornly defending their dogs. This trivial dispute highlights the absurdity of their situation, as they are unable to focus on the more important issue of marriage. The dog argument is a satire on the ridiculousness of human pride and the ways in which people can get caught up in insignificant issues, even when something serious like a proposal is at hand.

Q7: How does Chubukov react to Lomov’s proposal?
A7: Chubukov initially reacts with surprise and excitement when Lomov proposes to his daughter. He is overjoyed and quickly agrees to the marriage, thinking that Lomov’s offer is an excellent match for his daughter. However, his reaction soon turns into frustration and confusion as the argument between Lomov and Natalya intensifies. Chubukov’s character is comedic in his role as a father who is eager to marry off his daughter, but he becomes exasperated by the ridiculous arguments that derail the proposal.

Q8: How does the play depict the theme of marriage?
A8: The play depicts marriage in a satirical and humorous light. Marriage is portrayed as something that both Lomov and Natalya approach with a mix of practicality, desire for social standing, and personal insecurities. The play suggests that marriages in the society depicted are often based on convenience, status, and family expectations rather than genuine love or compatibility. The absurdity of the arguments and misunderstandings between Lomov and Natalya highlights the comedic and sometimes ridiculous nature of romantic relationships. Despite the trivial arguments, the play ends with the characters agreeing to the marriage, suggesting that love and marriage can be influenced by many factors, even if those factors are humorous or trivial.

Thinking about the Language
Q1: How does the dialogue between Lomov and Natalya reveal their personalities?
A1: The dialogue between Lomov and Natalya reveals their personalities through their reactions and the way they handle conflict. Lomov is portrayed as nervous, insecure, and overly concerned with minor details, such as his health and the superiority of his dog. He is unable to remain calm and is easily distracted by trivial matters. Natalya, on the other hand, is portrayed as passionate, stubborn, and argumentative. She is quick to take offense and defends her dog fiercely, showing her emotional and assertive nature. The way they bicker and misunderstand each other throughout the conversation highlights their immaturity and lack of self-awareness.

Q2: How does Chekhov use humor in the play?
A2: Chekhov uses humor in the play through exaggerated characters, absurd situations, and witty dialogues. The argument over the dogs, the misunderstandings surrounding Lomov’s proposal, and the comic timing of the characters all contribute to the humor. Chekhov’s use of repetition, with the characters continually arguing over the same trivial points, adds to the absurdity. The humor is also enhanced by the contrast between the serious intentions behind Lomov’s proposal and the petty distractions that derail it, creating a satirical commentary on the nature of relationships and social expectations.

Q3: What makes the play a farce?
A3: The play is a farce because it is filled with exaggerated situations, absurd misunderstandings, and humorous character traits. The characters are caught up in ridiculous arguments, such as the one about the dogs, which distract from the real issue of Lomov’s proposal. The play relies on slapstick humor, misunderstandings, and over-the-top emotions to create a sense of chaos and absurdity. The characters’ inability to communicate effectively and their focus on trivial matters, despite the serious nature of the proposal, are key elements that make the play a farce.
